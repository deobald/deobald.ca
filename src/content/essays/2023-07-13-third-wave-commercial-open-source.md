Commercial Open Source Softare (COSS) is an only-loosely-agreed-upon term for businesses built upon selling open source products.
COSS has seen two significant waves pass, with a third now emerging.
The head of each wave lasts approximately a decade.
The tail of each wave extends into the future indefinitely.
Each wave subsumes all previous waves.

The first wave was characterized by shrinkwrapping and commercial support.
Peaking in the mid-1990s, Red Hat was the poster-child of selling support for software written by other people.
On the surface, the literal shrinkwrapping is what many of us remember from this time period:
graphical installers, Linux on CD, and RPMs built by paid employees.
While branding and polish isn't to be underplayed, it was support the enterprise wanted -- and bought.

The second wave was characterized by Open Core products.
The term "Open Core" is harder to define than "Commercial Open Source".
There exist obvious examples of true open source cores to otherwise proprietary software products:
GitLab, Mattermost, and Metabase provide the classic Community Edition vs. Enterprise Edition dichotomy.
Other businesses are harder to categorize.
Many products -- including Telegram, Keybase, and Canonical Snap Store -- release open source clients to proprietary services and, arguably, don't qualify as commercial open source at all.
MySQL was one of the first products to capitalize on dual licensing, capitalizing on the restrictive nature of the GPL.
MySQL, while undoubtedly second-wave, is hard to justify characterizing as Open Core.
