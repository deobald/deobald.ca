(Quick note: As a requirement of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign the gag letter Robert McQueen sent me. However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation's directors, past and present. If any of the strategy below reads critically, rest assured my only interest is in helping the Foundation continue to grow into its next 25 years.)

[Like Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR_Uzf2B-YA&t=106s), I had no idea what happened back in August. I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day throughout my 3.5 months at the Foundation. Immediately following GUADEC, Allan went on vacation for a couple weeks and during that time the board held a few meetings I wasn't invited to. On August 13th, I was told I "wasn't a good fit." I think (hope?) that Allan was as surprised as I was when he returned from vacation on August 18th. My agreement to step down was largely due to the total lack of communication from the board at that time. People joke about an Executive Director having "nine bosses", which is its own kind of challenge but that challenge deepens if your bosses don't speak to you. The board's half of the decision was never discussed with me and their decision was never explained.

I still have no idea what happened in August. I'm beginning to believe I never will. I'm still frustrated by this: Between the 6-month interview process, the 3 or 4 month stint, and the offboarding period, this consumed nearly a year of my life and career. That said, I'm finally getting my head above water, so I'm taking the time to publish the strategy I'd laid out while I was with the GNOME Foundation.

I didn't publish a strategy while I was in the ED role because if there was one thing I heard from every corner of the community it was "DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES." I took this to heart and generally only spoke about the work the team accomplished once the work was already done.

I'm publishing a strategy now because (a) it's been four months since I left, which is roughly how long I was there and (b) I want the board's Community Executive to have this blueprint, regardless of whether they make use of it or not.

This strategy is broken down into two broad conceptual shifts in how the GNOME Foundation operates:

1. Focus On The Mission
2. Build An Institution

These each have quite a few items underneath them, but they provide useful questions for the community executive to ask themselves from time to time: "Are we focusing on the mission?" and "Are we building an institution?"

## Focus On The Mission

It is illegal for the GNOME Foundation to pursue any initiative other than it's 501(c)(3) mission, as declared on its Form 990 that it submits to the IRS. As of 2025, that mission is as follows:

> The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.

[As recently as the 2024 submission](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43572618), the mission statement was actually a bit clearer in its intent:

> GNOME Foundation provides charitable community benefit by broadening access to technology through the development and distribution of a usable free computer desktop software to people in countries around the world for whom operable computers would otherwise have been unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

...but I'm guessing most of us can agree on both mission statements are equally applicable and that the activity the GNOME Foundation was incorporated to engage in is "build a Free Software desktop", where "free" takes both meanings and "desktop" also applies to rectangle form-factor computers like laptops and phones.

In short, the GNOME Foundation exists to support GNOME. Nothing else.

### Care Must Be Taken

It is important that directors of the board do not get bogged down in other well-meaning initiatives.

As of 2026, for better or for worse, the GNOME Foundation is incorporated in the United States. There are many concepts or initiatives we, in other countries, take for granted as positive forces for society. In the United States (especially under its current administration), most of these are still hot-button political issues. No matter how useful, positive, or wholesome such an initiative may be, the GNOME Foundation cannot legally pursue that initiative under its charter. The Foundation doesn't exist to solve climate change, eliminate poverty, end genocide, or fight human rights violations. It cannot legally do those things. Nor should it --- a tiny organization like the GNOME Foundation cannot solve all of humanity's problems.

I am of the opinion that the Python Software Foundation strikes the right balance, here. Back in October, they [withdrew from a $1.5m USA government grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html) that they were almost guaranteed to win because the terms violated their ethics and betrayed the trust of their community. This is the kind of principled stance the GNOME Foundation can and should still make. The PSF is a brilliant role model based on this one example alone.

The purpose of the GNOME Foundation is to provide a trustworthy, sustainable, accessible Free Software ecosystem to everyone --- in every country --- while stewarding a safe, welcoming community.

Do that.

### Fill In The Gaps

While it's quaint to suggest that [fundraising via Friends of GNOME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptltPdcXH0Q) pays for most of GNOME, there isn't a single GNOME Foundation member who believes this. The vast majority of GNOME's development comes from the hard work of folks at companies like Red Hat and Igalia. The majority of them get paid full-time to work on GNOME and then spend their evenings and weekends on their favourite hobby: hacking on GNOME.

The rest of GNOME's development comes from volunteers, unrestricted grants, and contract work. The massive effort enabled by the [STF contract](TODO: link) is a recent example.

To my knowledge, the GNOME Foundation has only ever engaged in the act of software development via _restricted_ grants. This includes [work on GTK from 2018 to 2021](TODO: link), and work on Digital Wellbeing and GLib in recent years. There's absolutely nothing wrong with restricted grants and hopefully the Foundation continues to receive such grants.

However, for the GNOME Foundation to fulfill its nonprofit mission, I believe its role is to "fill in the gaps." Companies like Red Hat and Canonical only have so many degrees of freedom --- the software they write will, generally, try to make their customers happy. That's just... how you run a company. But there are times when commercial incentives won't get certain software built. GNOME Calendar is, arguably, the most beautiful calendar app out there --- but it lacks essential features because it's 100% volunteer-built. GNOME's accessibility (#a11y) story gets better every release --- but major gaps exist, even in 2026. The diagram that follows is a doodle I created for the Fundraising Committee when I left:

The entire diagram can be seen on Excalidraw. This largely covers my outreach and fundraising strategy, but I'm happy to answer questions about it if anyone has them.

## Build An Institution

* build an institution
  * succession planning
    * network resilience
    * documentation
  * "death" - david, aaron, 501c3 good governance
  * nurture the next generation: Design Team as good example
    * committee rotation => CoCC rotation
    * actually _slow_ board rotation

* grow the membership
  * onboard app developers - Quickstart, demonstrate the attactiveness of the GNOME platform for building native apps, senior devs get bored easily, #lofi is coming
  * events = opportunity to communicate and collaborate, densely. opportunity for old-timers to provide history and help the next generation learn non-technical skills needed for an extended f/oss community.
  * link rich's conj open? ("confer" = "give")
  * ad board = meeting ground, home for old-timers
  * stop the slow bleed
  * communicate heavily with members


  * financial stability
    * slide deck
    * excalidraw
  * organizational excellence
  * diversity
  * Flathub LLC co-owned by KDE e.V.
  * paradox: requires vision and benefits from a mascot
  * in short: run a nonprofit like any other business

I've had a lot to say about building institutions over the years. Most recently, [I spoke about this on the Lifestyle Democracy Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/lifestyle-democracy/episodes/the-future-of-tech-worker-cooperatives-institutions-not-star). I've been beating the same dead horse... er, drum... for years now: if you build a corporation but that corporation dies with you, then you haven't built anything at all.

This applies even more acutely to nonprofits than it does to for-profit companies. There is no such thing as a nonprofit "family business." The institution is everything.

### Succession Planning

Succession planning (sometimes called _continuity planning_) is essential in competent governance, regardless of corporate structure. But in a nonprofit, it's all the more important because of the additional layers of oversight. In a 501(c)(3), that includes scrutiny from both the IRS and the Attorney General. Continuity planning is a component of every director's fiduciary duty to the corporation.

While I was in the ED role, I think people were surprised that I didn't shy away from the topic of death. Americans, in particular, seemed bothered by this. (It was once even demanded of me that I refrain from using the term "bus factor.") I did avoid the topic with the two people who requested it of me. I [provided content warnings](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?si=eafOWsUprdsQhwY3&t=46) in group contexts. But the fact that more than one person raised the issue with me led me to reflect on the topic more deeply in the autumn.

I lost a first cousin two days my senior last year. My brother went through six months of intense chemo this year. (He's doing fine now.) I've considered death a lot in the past two years, even if subconsciously.

Consciously, however, I don't think the topic can be avoided by anyone with the maturity to build a corporation which will outlive them. Inherently, the topic of succession planning includes emergency succession. With the Covid-19 pandemic barely behind us, it's easy to forget that [nonprofits and for-profits alike were scrambling to construct succession plans](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348417640_Revitalising_Organisations'_Emergency_Succession_Planning_in_the_Face_of_the_Covid-19_Outbreak) not that long ago. The GNOME Foundation should have one.

### Nurture The Next Generation

Every aspect of GNOME needs to encourage and grow the next generation of contributors, not just the Foundation. The Design Team does a great job of this and I hope they don't mind me calling them out. The Core Design Team is kind of broken down by generation: old farts like Jakub and Allan, the middle generation like Sam and Tobias, and the young folks like Jamie and Kramo. I've attended Design Team meetings. They're a productive and mindful group. I have little doubt that mindfulness is a large part of them considering how to ensure GNOME's design doesn't stagnate and that no one is a SPOF.

[Emmanuele talked about other project strategies](TODO: link) at GUADEC 2025. The board and staff are loosening some of these knots. Knowledge-sharing and [pairing on roles](todo: link pres/secretary) is a great way to unstick the Foundation's legacy processes. Pushing the staff to become cross-functional is another. This work has begun. It just needs to continue.

For the avoidance of doubt, I'll call out explicitly: "continuity planning" never refers to "continuity" by way of keeping the same person in the same role indefinitely. If we were immortal (and if someone were willing to work the same job for hundreds of years), we could plan this way. Since we are not, the "continuity" we're planning for is a transition: from one person or one group of people to another person or another group of people.

I bring this up because different corners of the GNOME Foundation (and the GNOME project) seem to view this from different angles, and it drives me slightly nuts when folks confuse consistency with continuity.

### Committee Rotation

Every committee should experience some amount of rotation, every year. Most do, with one notable exception: the Code of Conduct Committee.

Given that this was the only committee I ever received complaints about as Executive Director (many complaints, from all but one corner of the community), I strongly encourage the board to heavily rotate the Code of Conduct Committee, as soon as they have the bandwidth to do so.

### Slow Board Rotation

Paradoxically, I would love to see the board _slow_ its rotation. Prior to Holly's appointment as ED, the board would sometimes rotate in its entirety _every single year._ Holly, with her nonprofit experience, helped the board plug that hole. However, when I asked certain directors of the board if they would be willing to seek a second term, I heard a very tired "if I'm asked to serve, I can."

Serving on the board should neither be a luxury, nor a chore. It should strike a balance between the serious work of governance and avoiding burnout. Ideally, elections should decide when a board member is rotated out. At the moment, barely enough members run for elections to fill the available seats. I coaxed all four candidates in the 2025 elections to run.

A slower board rotation would indicate a few things: It would indicate that the work is no longer soul-crushing. It would indicate that the membership is actually happy with the work the Foundation does. It would indicate that the directors are getting comfortable with the few small operational tasks required of an organization of this scale.

If we combine the desire for succession planning with the desire for slower board rotation, the outcome is acute: the longest-serving board members are asked to step out of Officer roles and bow out of the board.

### Documentation

When I joined the GNOME Foundation, there was no operational documentation. This was, in part, a tooling problem: the Foundation had jumped between wikis and Nextcloud and Google Docs on multiple occasions. Still, 25 years is a long time to get some basic SOPs in place. While I was there, Bart and Andrea created a single, internal, go-to Sphinx instance in the style of [https://handbook.gnome.org](https://handbook.gnome.org) --- I sincerely hope this is still going and that the board is incrementally fleshing it out.

Clear documentation, centralized at a single location, is how the Foundation will manage its people transitions. Hand-offs are great, but board members and staff alike should have a single README-style document from which they can find everything else they need to keep the Foundation running smoothly.

I should clarify that non-operational processes were well documented: board policies, accounting practices (courtesy Rebecca the bookkeeper), and infrastructure documentation (courtesy Bart and Andrea). But even these need to be discoverable, which is where the Foundation Handbook comes in. If someone has a question about infrastructure, their first port of call shouldn't be waking Andrea up in the middle of the night.

## financial stability

* fiscal policy
  * fiscal controls = started
  * reduce costs
  * focus on MRR/ARR
  * aside: Ankur's shock at Foundation budgets
  * balance the budget, YoY
  * board reserve

* fundraising
  * slide deck (costs can be derived from 990s)
  * d.g.o
  * fund development
  * talk about gnome on podcasts, youtube
  * stop Canonical from patching out Donate notification in Ubuntu


## Organizational Excellence

* feedback
  * help board & community members
  * build a healthier community with healthier communication
  * avoid instantly going over someone's head

* board
  * I had it backwards: hackers make good directors
  * where are our Canonical friends? -- they're on the Ad Board; get them memberships and get them on the board, too

* policy governance
  * this would still be my preference but, after August, I'm not convinced it's a good idea for the Foundation to have a staff ED ... no one wants to work for 9 bosses who ghost you for weeks at a time.
  * perhaps the current situation is the best possible outcome: have the board accept that they're deeply involved in the foundation's executive activities anyway, and maintain a community executive, rather than staff.

* shift to infrastructure
  * operational struggles
  * infra doesn't have this problem: bart and andrea are excellent and very trustworthy
  * banking has been moved into the treasury function (pres, treasurer), non-banking tools should move into infra: Stripe, Wise.com, etc.
  * automate

* accountability, feedback, open honest comm
  * private chan in matrix
  * private area in discourse?
  * transparency at scales: exec, board, membership, hackers, public
  * "transparency" does not mean everyone can read every line item in the Foundation's accounting history, see what every contractor is being paid, or otherwise firehose the general public with information

* documents and documentation
  * a component of succession planning
  * archival policy, retention policy


## Diversity

* corporate diversity (spread out Red Hat risk)
* more diversity in hackers, not the board
  * the board is made of members; don't force board diversity if it's not there in the membership; solve the root problem
* broaden the base: bring in more app developers
* focus less on outreach programs like Outreachy and GSoC (which would help unburden Felipe, also) and focus more on mid- to senior-level developers.
