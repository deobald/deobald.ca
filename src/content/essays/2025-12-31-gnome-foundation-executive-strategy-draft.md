(Quick note: As a requirement of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign the gag letter Robert McQueen sent me. However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation's directors, past and present. If any of the strategy below reads critically, rest assured my only interest is in helping the Foundation continue to grow into its next 25 years.)

[Like Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR_Uzf2B-YA&t=106s), I had no idea what happened back in August. I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day throughout my 3.5 months at the Foundation. Immediately following GUADEC, Allan went on vacation for a couple weeks and during that time the board held a few meetings I wasn't invited to. On August 13th, I was told I "wasn't a good fit." I think (hope?) that Allan was as surprised as I was when he returned from vacation on August 18th. My agreement to step down was largely due to the total lack of communication from the board at that time. People joke about an Executive Director having "nine bosses", which is its own kind of challenge but that challenge deepens if your bosses don't speak to you. The board's half of the decision was never discussed with me and their decision was never explained.

I still have no idea what happened in August. I'm beginning to believe I never will. I'm still frustrated by this: Between the 6-month interview process, the 3 or 4 month stint, and the offboarding period, this consumed nearly a year of my life and career. That said, I'm finally getting my head above water, so I'm taking the time to publish the strategy I'd laid out while I was with the GNOME Foundation.

I didn't publish a strategy while I was in the ED role because if there was one thing I heard from every corner of the community it was "DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES." I took this to heart and generally only spoke about the work the team accomplished once the work was already done.

I'm publishing a strategy now because (a) it's been four months since I left, which is roughly how long I was there and (b) I want the board's Community Executive to have this blueprint, regardless of whether they make use of it or not.

This strategy is broken down into two broad conceptual shifts in how the GNOME Foundation operates:

1. Focus On The Mission
2. Build An Institution

These each have quite a few items underneath them, but they provide useful questions for the community executive to ask themselves from time to time: "Are we focusing on the mission?" and "Are we building an institution?"

## Focus On The Mission

It is illegal for the GNOME Foundation to pursue any initiative other than it's 501(c)(3) mission, as declared on its Form 990 that it submits to the IRS. As of 2025, that mission is as follows:

> The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.

[As recently as the 2024 submission](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43572618), the mission statement was actually a bit clearer in its intent:

> GNOME Foundation provides charitable community benefit by broadening access to technology through the development and distribution of a usable free computer desktop software to people in countries around the world for whom operable computers would otherwise have been unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

...but I'm guessing most of us can agree on both mission statements are equally applicable and that the activity the GNOME Foundation was incorporated to engage in is "build a Free Software desktop", where "free" takes both meanings and "desktop" also applies to rectangle form-factor computers like laptops and phones.

In short, the GNOME Foundation exists to support GNOME. Nothing else.

### Care Must Be Taken

It is important that directors of the board do not get bogged down in other well-meaning initiatives.

As of 2026, for better or for worse, the GNOME Foundation is incorporated in the United States. There are many concepts or initiatives we, in other countries, take for granted as positive forces for society. In the United States (especially under its current administration), most of these are still hot-button political issues. No matter how useful, positive, or wholesome such an initiative may be, the GNOME Foundation cannot legally pursue that initiative under its charter. It doesn't exist to solve climate change, eliminate poverty, end genocide, or fight human rights violations. It cannot legally do those things. Nor should it --- a tiny organization like the GNOME Foundation cannot solve all of humanity's problems.

I am of the opinion that the Python Software Foundation strikes the right balance, here. Back in October, they [withdrew from a $1.5m USA government grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html) that they were almost guaranteed to win because the terms violated their ethics and betrayed the trust of their community. This is the kind of principled stance the GNOME Foundation can and should still make. The PSF is a brilliant role model based on this one example alone.

The purpose of the GNOME Foundation is to provide a trustworthy, diverse, sustainable, accessible Free Software ecosystem to everyone --- in every country --- while stewarding a safe, welcoming community.

Do that.

## Build An Institution

I've had a lot to say about building institutions over the years. Most recently, [I spoke about this on the Lifestyle Democracy Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/lifestyle-democracy/episodes/the-future-of-tech-worker-cooperatives-institutions-not-star). I've been beating the same dead horse... er, drum... for years now: if you build a corporation but that corporation dies with you? Then you haven't built anything at all.

This applies even more acutely to nonprofits than it does to for-profit companies. There is no such thing as a nonprofit "family business." The institution is everything.

* focus on the institution
  * succession planning
  * financial stability
  * organizational excellence
  * diversity
  * Flathub LLC co-owned by KDE e.V.
  * paradox: requires vision and benefits from a mascot
  * in short: run a nonprofit like any other business

## Succession Planning

Succession planning is essential in competent governance, regardless of corporate structure. But in a nonprofit, it's all the more important because of the additional layers of oversight. In a 501(c)(3), that includes scrutiny from both the IRS and the Attorney General. It's a component of every director's fiduciary duty to the corporation.

While I was in the ED role, I think people were surprised that I didn't shy away from the topic of death. Americans, in particular, seemed bothered by this. (It was once even demanded of me that I avoid the use of the term "bus factor.") I did avoid the topic with the two people who requested it of me. I [provided content warnings](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?si=eafOWsUprdsQhwY3&t=46) in group contexts. But the fact that more than one person raised the issue with me led me to reflect on the topic more deeply in the autumn.

For those who have wondered this about me: I lost a first cousin two days my senior last year. My brother went through six months of intense chemo this year. (He's doing fine now.) Death has been with me, even if subconsciously.

Consciously, however, I don't think the topic can be avoided by anyone with the maturity to consider building a corporation which will outlive them. Inherently, the topic of succession planning includes emergency succession. With the Covid-19 pandemic barely behind us, it's easy to forget that [nonprofits were scrambling to construct succession plans](https://independentsector.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/A-Shock-to-the-Status-Quo-IS-White-Paper.pdf) not that long ago. The GNOME Foundation should have one.

### Nurture The Next Generation



* "death" - david, aaron, 501c3 good governance
* nurture the next generation: Design Team as good example
  * committee rotation => CoCC rotation
  * actually _slow_ board rotation
* onboard app developers - Quickstart, demonstrate the attactiveness of the GNOME platform for building native apps, senior devs get bored easily, #lofi is coming
* events = opportunity to communicate and collaborate, densely. opportunity for old-timers to provide history and help the next generation learn non-technical skills needed for an extended f/oss community.
  * link rich's conj open? ("confer" = "give")
* ad board = meeting ground, home for old-timers
* stop the slow bleed
* communicate heavily with members

## financial stability

* fiscal policy
  * fiscal controls = started
  * reduce costs
  * focus on MRR/ARR
  * aside: Ankur's shock at Foundation budgets
  * balance the budget, YoY
  * board reserve

* fundraising
  * slide deck (costs can be derived from 990s)
  * d.g.o
  * fund development
  * talk about gnome on podcasts, youtube
  * stop Canonical from patching out Donate notification in Ubuntu


## Organizational Excellence

* feedback
  * help board & community members
  * build a healthier community with healthier communication
  * avoid instantly going over someone's head

* board
  * I had it backwards: hackers make good directors
  * where are our Canonical friends? -- they're on the Ad Board; get them memberships and get them on the board, too

* policy governance
  * this would still be my preference but, after August, I'm not convinced it's a good idea for the Foundation to have a staff ED ... no one wants to work for 9 bosses who ghost you for weeks at a time.
  * perhaps the current situation is the best possible outcome: have the board accept that they're deeply involved in the foundation's executive activities anyway, and maintain a community executive, rather than staff.

* shift to infrastructure
  * operational struggles
  * infra doesn't have this problem: bart and andrea are excellent and very trustworthy
  * banking has been moved into the treasury function (pres, treasurer), non-banking tools should move into infra: Stripe, Wise.com, etc.
  * automate

* accountability, feedback, open honest comm
  * private chan in matrix
  * private area in discourse?
  * transparency at scales: exec, board, membership, hackers, public
  * "transparency" does not mean everyone can read every line item in the Foundation's accounting history, see what every contractor is being paid, or otherwise firehose the general public with information

* documents and documentation
  * a component of succession planning
  * archival policy, retention policy


## Diversity

* corporate diversity (spread out Red Hat risk)
* more diversity in hackers, not the board
  * the board is made of members; don't force board diversity if it's not there in the membership; solve the root problem
* broaden the base: bring in more app developers
* focus less on outreach programs like Outreachy and GSoC (which would help unburden Felipe, also) and focus more on mid- to senior-level developers.
