[Like Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR_Uzf2B-YA&t=106s), I had no idea what happened back in August. I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day throughout my 3.5 months at the Foundation. Immediately following GUADEC, Allan went on vacation for a couple weeks and during that time the board held a few meetings I wasn't invited to. On August 13th, Robert McQueen called me to tell me I "wasn't a good fit." I had no idea what that meant. The board's half of the decision was never discussed with me and their decision was never explained. It's my understanding that Allan was as surprised as I was when he returned from vacation on August 18th. My agreement to step down was largely due to the total lack of communication from the board at that time. People joke about an Executive Director having "nine bosses", which is its own kind of challenge. That challenge really deepens if those bosses don't speak to you.

I know what happened to me at GUADEC, at the end of July. It was unpleasant. But I still don't know what happened in August. I probably never will. For the time-being, I just want the GNOME community to know that I didn't give up on you. If the board opts to hire a staff Executive Director in the future, I sincerely hope they learn to talk through their problems openly before they start recruiting.

I didn't publish a strategy while I was in the ED role because if there was one thing I heard from every corner of the community it was "DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES." I took this to heart and generally only spoke about the work the team accomplished once the work was already done.

I'm publishing a strategy now because (a) it's been four months since I left, which is roughly how long I was there, (b) I've had time to cool off emotionally, and (c) I want the board's Community Executive to have this blueprint, whether they make use of it or not.

(Cooling off emotionally was important because August left me confused and, honestly, frightened. In my 30 years of employment, this is the first time I've ever felt _unsafe_ at a workplace. It's a real brainscrew to know somebody had a problem with me, that they were willing to escalate to the board without bringing it to me first, and that the problem, whatever it was, caused the board to ask me to leave --- without a clear indication _what that problem might be._ I was completely in the dark and there is nothing as scary as one's own imagination. When I re-read the announcement from September, I realized it reads "he did everything right...but we still had to part ways." It looked like I'd embezzled money or abused someone or something else equally insane. I needed some distance from that.)

* * *

Quick note: As a condition of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign [_One Of Those Things_](https://youtu.be/NUC2EQvdzmY). However, I retained the right to speak critically of the Foundation, its staff, and its directors --- past and present. If the comment above, or any of the strategy below, reads critically, rest assured my only interest is in helping the Foundation continue to grow into its next 25 years. I still really want the Foundation to succeed.

* * *

This strategy hinges on three broad conceptual shifts in how the GNOME Foundation operates:

1. Focus On The Mission
2. Build An Institution
3. Demand Organizational Excellence

There's quite a bit of detail sandwiched in between (the usual stuff like event planning and financial policy), but these three ideals provide a useful framework upon which the Community Executive can ask themselves these questions, from time to time: "Are we focusing on the mission?" and "Are we building an institution?" and "Are we demanding the same level of excellence from the Foundation that we demand from the project?"

## Focus On The Mission

It is illegal for the GNOME Foundation to pursue any initiative other than it's 501(c)(3) mission, as declared on its Form 990 that it submits to the IRS. As of 2025, that mission is as follows:

> The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.

As recently as [the 2024 (FY23) IRS  submission](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43572618/202412259349302181/full), the mission statement was actually a bit clearer in its intent:

> GNOME Foundation provides charitable community benefit by broadening access to technology through the development and distribution of a usable free computer desktop software to people in countries around the world for whom operable computers would otherwise have been unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

...but I'm guessing most of us can agree that both mission statements are equally applicable and that the activity the GNOME Foundation was incorporated to engage in is "build a Free Software desktop", where "free" takes both meanings and "desktop" also applies to rectangle form-factor computers like laptops and phones.

In short, the GNOME Foundation exists to support the development of GNOME. Nothing else.

### Care Must Be Taken

It is important that directors of the board do not get bogged down in other well-meaning initiatives.

As of 2026, for better or for worse, the GNOME Foundation is incorporated in the United States. There are many concepts or initiatives we, in other countries, take for granted as positive forces for society. In the United States (especially under its current administration), most of these are still hot-button political issues. No matter how useful, positive, or wholesome such an initiative may be, the GNOME Foundation cannot legally pursue that initiative under its charter. The Foundation doesn't exist to solve climate change, eliminate poverty, end genocide, or fight human rights violations. It cannot legally do those things. Nor should it --- a tiny organization like the GNOME Foundation cannot solve all of humanity's problems.

I am of the opinion that the Python Software Foundation strikes the right balance, here. Back in October, they [withdrew from a $1.5m USA government grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html) that they were almost guaranteed to win because the terms violated their ethics and betrayed the trust of their community. This is the kind of principled stance the GNOME Foundation can and should still make. The PSF is a brilliant role model based on this one example alone.

The purpose of the GNOME Foundation is to provide a trustworthy, sustainable, accessible Free Software ecosystem to everyone --- in every country --- while stewarding a safe, welcoming community.

Do that.

### Fill In The Gaps

While it's quaint to suggest that the Foundation pays for most of GNOME's development, as the `@gnome` Bluesky account keeps suggesting, there isn't a single GNOME Foundation member who believes this.

The vast majority of GNOME's development comes from the hard work of folks at companies like Red Hat and Igalia. The majority of them get paid full-time to work on GNOME and then spend their evenings and weekends on their favourite hobby: hacking on GNOME.

The rest of GNOME's development comes from volunteers, restricted grants, and contract work. The massive effort enabled by the [STF contract](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/) is a recent example.

To my knowledge, other than the STF contract, the GNOME Foundation has only ever engaged in the act of software development via grants. This includes work on GTK from [2018](https://blogs.gnome.org/foundation/2020/11/24/gtk-at-the-heart-of-gnome/) to [2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816015216/https://wiki.gnome.org/FoundationBoard/Minutes/20220112), and the work on Digital Wellbeing and GLib in recent years. There's absolutely nothing wrong with restricted grants and hopefully the Foundation continues to receive such grants.

However, for the GNOME Foundation to fulfill its nonprofit mission, I believe its role is to "fill in the gaps." Companies like Red Hat and Canonical only have so many degrees of freedom --- the software they write will, generally, try to make their customers happy. That's just... how you run a company. But there are times when commercial incentives won't get certain software built. GNOME Calendar is, arguably, the most beautiful calendar app out there --- but it lacks essential features because it's 100% volunteer-built. GNOME's accessibility (#a11y) story gets better every release --- but major gaps exist, even in 2026. The diagram that follows is a doodle I created for the Fundraising Committee when I left:

![Filling The Gaps](/img/2025-12-31-gnome-foundation-fill-gaps.png)

[The entire diagram](https://excalidraw.com/#json=3iN6VclACR5te9Czs5bHp,BlEAC-_2qLylKP_CuRBEkQ) can be seen on Excalidraw. This largely covers my outreach and fundraising strategy, but I'm happy to answer questions about it if anyone has them. There's nothing new in there. It mostly consists of things I've said in my blog, GUADEC 2025 keynote, or in public Matrix channels... but it puts it all in one place.

### Include Infrastructure

Where the Foundation has struggled to fund development, it has absolutely excelled at infrastructure. GNOME isn't just a CD-ROM full of packages anymore. Partnering with KDE, it's also the amazing [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) effort. It's also [GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/). It's project walls, build pipelines, office tools, and an open source [Zoom replacement](https://meet.gnome.org/) for Foundation members.

Some of this infrastructure serves users directly and the desktop wouldn't work without it. Other infrastructure ensures GNOME development can happen 24 hours a day. It's all essential. In 2026, infrastructure is part of the mission.

## Build An Institution

I've had a lot to say about building institutions over the years. Most recently, [I spoke about this on the Lifestyle Democracy Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/lifestyle-democracy/episodes/the-future-of-tech-worker-cooperatives-institutions-not-star). I've been beating the same dead horse... er, drum... for years now: if you build a corporation but that corporation dies with you, then you haven't built anything at all.

This applies even more acutely to nonprofits than it does to for-profit companies. There is no such thing as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit "family business." The institution is everything.

### Succession Planning

Succession planning (sometimes called _continuity planning_) is essential in competent governance, regardless of corporate structure. But in a nonprofit, it's all the more important because of the additional layers of oversight. In a 501(c)(3), that includes scrutiny from both the IRS and the Attorney General. Continuity planning is a component of every director's fiduciary duty to the corporation.

While I was in the ED role, I think people were surprised that I didn't shy away from the topic of death. Americans, in particular, seemed bothered by this. (One person even demanded that I not say "bus factor.") I did avoid the topic with the two Americans who requested it of me. I [provided content warnings](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?si=eafOWsUprdsQhwY3&t=46) in group contexts. But the fact that more than one person raised the issue with me led me to reflect on the topic more deeply in the autumn.

I lost a first cousin last year. He was two days my senior. My brother went through six months of intense chemo this year. (He's doing fine now.) I've considered death a lot in the past two years, even if subconsciously.

Consciously, however, I don't think the topic can be avoided by anyone with the maturity to build a corporation which must outlive them. Inherently, the topic of succession planning includes emergency succession. With the Covid-19 pandemic barely behind us, it's easy to forget that nonprofits and for-profits alike were [scrambling to construct succession plans](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348417640_Revitalising_Organisations'_Emergency_Succession_Planning_in_the_Face_of_the_Covid-19_Outbreak) not that long ago. The nonprofit space is very supportive, and there was [plenty of simple, easy-to-understand advice](https://blueavocado.org/leadership-and-management/how-to-plan-and-execute-an-emergency-succession/) for creating succession plans during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The GNOME Foundation needs a succession plan.

### Nurture The Next Generation

Every aspect of GNOME needs to encourage and grow the next generation of contributors, not just the Foundation. The Design Team does a great job of this and I hope they don't mind me calling them out. The Core Design Team is kind of broken down by generation: old farts like Jakub and Allan, the middle generation like Sam and Tobias, and the young folks like Jamie and Kramo. I've attended Design Team meetings. They're a productive and mindful group. I have little doubt that mindfulness is a large part of them considering how to ensure GNOME's design doesn't stagnate and that no one becomes a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).

Emmanuele [talked about creating a steering group](https://www.youtube.com/live/18Ir6RXkIeA?si=uwOFJUYtRga7hYTZ&t=3381) at GUADEC 2025 --- this is a good idea. The board and staff are loosening some of these knots at the Foundation. Knowledge-sharing and [pairing up on Officer roles](https://handbook.gnome.org/foundation/board-of-directors/officers.html) is a great way to unstick the Foundation's legacy processes. Pushing the staff to become cross-functional is another. This work has begun. It just needs to continue.

For the avoidance of doubt, I'll call out explicitly: "continuity planning" never refers to "continuity" by way of keeping the same person in the same role indefinitely. If we were immortal (and if someone were willing to work the same job for hundreds of years), we could plan this way. Since we are not, the "continuity" we're planning for is a transition: from one person or one group of people to another person or another group of people.

I bring this up because different corners of the GNOME Foundation (and the GNOME project) seem to view this from different angles. We shouldn't confuse consistency with continuity.

Keeping one person in the same role without redundancy for years and years also has a tendency to cause gatekeeping. We all fall victim to the habit of gatekeeping, even unconsciously. And it has a tendency to perpetuate itself: if I'm the only person who's done a job for 5, 10, or 15 years, I'm bound to start believing I'm the _only_ person who can do that job. Of course this is never true, so it's always a good idea to make sure at least one other person understands how you do your job.

### Committee Rotation

Every committee should experience some amount of rotation, every year. Most do, with one notable exception: the Code of Conduct Committee.

Given that this was the only committee I ever received complaints about as Executive Director (_many_ complaints, from most corners of the community), I strongly encourage the board to heavily rotate the Code of Conduct Committee, as soon as they have the bandwidth to do so. They can probably start by documenting the entrance criteria: how does someone join the CoCC? Currently, that's unclear. It's just listed as ["invitation only"](https://handbook.gnome.org/foundation/committees/coc.html#membership), which isn't very helpful and makes it seem more like a fun club than a group committed to community safety.

Should the CoCC feel overly criticized and decide to delete this post from Planet GNOME, there will always be a copy [on my personal website](https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2025-12-31-gnome-foundation-2-executive-strategy/).

At a higher level, the board would be well-served with a policy on committee rotation for all committees, to prevent stagnation.

### Slow Board Rotation

Paradoxically, I would love to see the board _slow_ its rotation. Prior to Holly Million's appointment as ED, the board would sometimes rotate in its entirety _every single year._ Holly, with her nonprofit experience, helped the board fix that bug. However, when I asked past directors if they would be willing to re-join the board, I would hear this, in an exhausted voice: "if I'm asked to serve, I can."

Serving on the board should be neither a luxury, nor a chore. It should strike a balance between the serious work of governance and avoiding burnout. Ideally, elections should decide when a board member is rotated out. At the moment, barely enough members run for elections to fill the available seats. I had to coax all four candidates in the 2025 elections to run.

A slower board rotation would indicate a few things: It would indicate that the work is no longer soul-crushing. It would indicate that the membership is actually happy with the work the Foundation does. It would indicate that the directors are getting comfortable with the few small operational tasks required of a working board in an organization of this scale.

Combining succession planning with slower board rotation, the outcome should be healthy evolution: the longest-serving board members are asked to step out of Officer roles and, eventually, bow out of the board.

### Documentation

When I joined the GNOME Foundation, there was no operational or executive documentation to speak of. This was, in part, a tooling problem: the Foundation had jumped between wikis and GitLab and Nextcloud and Google Docs on multiple occasions. Still, 25 years is a long time to go without even basic SOPs. While I was there, Bart and Andrea created a single, private, go-to Sphinx instance in the style of [https://handbook.gnome.org](https://handbook.gnome.org) --- I sincerely hope this is still going and that the board is incrementally fleshing it out.

Clear documentation, centralized at a single location, is how the Foundation will manage its people transitions. Hand-offs are great, but board members and staff alike should have a single README-style resource from which they can find everything else they need to keep the Foundation running smoothly. That's the Foundation Handbook.

I should clarify that non-operational processes were well documented: board policies, accounting practices (courtesy Rebecca the bookkeeper), and infrastructure blueprints (courtesy Bart and Andrea). But even these need to be discoverable, which is where the Foundation Handbook comes in. If someone has a question about infrastructure, their first port of call should be a document linked from the Handbook, not waking up Andrea in the middle of the night.

Once the Foundation's documentation has started to tighten up, it would be wise to implement a document archival and retention policy designed for the long term. We began this work while I was ED and managed to get all of the Foundation's historical documents into Nextcloud, but there's still quite a bit of work to do in terms of making the archival process repeatable and discoverable for new officers and staff.

### Network Resilience

If you paid much attention to the things I was saying in the spring and summer of 2025, you definitely heard me speak about "network resilience." Documentation is a part of that resilience but redundancy carries more weight. Documentation can get out of date. Documentation requires that the author write in such a way that the reader doesn't misinterpret what is being said.

The advantage that human redundancy carries over documentation is that it directly represents the truth on the ground. A Deputy Executive Director has access to, and understands, all of the work of the Executive Director. An involved Vice President is familiar with the strategy and policy of the President.

Helpfully, redundancy in every role ensures the documentation remains up-to-date. If the Foundation needs to execute some mundane-but-essential task, like [renewing the trademark](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2026/01/09/gnome-foundation-update-2026-01-09/), have the less-experienced person execute by following the documentation, while pairing with the more experienced person. Pairing on these kinds of slow-cycle tasks while following the documentation will lead to the usual brand of insightful questions, such as "Do we still have the same trademark lawyer we had 10 years ago?" and "Has international trademark law changed significantly, causing us to require registration in a new jurisdiction?"

## Grow The Community

The GNOME Foundation's responsibility is to the community. The membership. This makes it the Foundation's responsibility to grow the membership. This can happen in many ways.

First, and this is a personal preference, I would love to see a greater focus on app developers. Every janky JavaScript framework cooked up in a weekend has a very lightweight _Quickstart_ document. While [developer.gnome.org](https://developer.gnome.org/) does have Beginner Tutorials, it doesn't have a short document that assumes the reader already knows half a dozen programming languages and just wants to get from zero to Baby's First Adwaita App in under 3 minutes. Writing documentation can be a joy (I personally loved writing [docs.endatabas.com](https://docs.endatabas.com/tutorial/quickstart)) but it's a chore more often than not. Where `developer.gnome.org` has gaps, the Foundation should help flesh those out. I believe a Quickstart (short enough to be printed on an A4) would be a great place to start.

I'll pause here to explain part of why I think this is so important. It's not a beef with the current GNOME docs; they're quite lovely. The importance is capturing the moment. Desktop Linux is going gangbusters. Meanwhile, every senior dev and their cat is trying to think of an app to build on top of local-first tech like [p2panda](https://p2panda.org/) and [Automerge](https://automerge.org/). Most of the people switching to Linux are, themselves, developers who are fed up with MacOS. A lot of those developers will just [do what Linus does](https://youtu.be/mfv0V1SxbNA?si=yte6DTa9MMuOdHSj&t=2711) and install Fedora. They will probably run GNOME. If they want to spend a weekend tossing together a D&D campaign manager app, recipe app, or the perfect local-first todo list app, the Foundation should encourage that. Native app development on Linux is _fun_ and _addictive._ Good quickstart docs are the gateway drug, and they're cheap to make. (Cheaper than maintaining [Workbench](https://flathub.org/en/apps/re.sonny.Workbench), though the Quickstart itself should probably point Workbench out to the reader, who would have never heard of it.)

Second to the app developer focus comes a focus on platform developers. From the Foundation's perspective, this effort is twofold: to pay developers directly to work on the platform and then to encourage corporate diversity (ctrl+f for "diversity" to read more on what I mean by that) so up-and-coming platform devs have a soft landing.

Paying platform developers means more than internships. While internships are a wonderful way to encourage inexperienced folks to build their skills and contribute to open source, they have a pretty low hit rate of keeping people in the f/oss ecosystem, historically. Why? Because everyone needs to eat. If there aren't jobs in GNOME tech after an internship finishes, a GNOME intern is just going to get gobbled up writing Yet Another React App or some cloud-native doodad in Go. It's not 1997. You can't assume these folks are going to sacrifice every evening and weekend for open source anymore.

Instead, it's preferable to find someone who would be a "lateral hire" in a regular company. The global income gap sucks in just about every way... except for this. If you have $1500/mo to spend on maintaining GLib, find a C hacker in a developing economy for whom that's a comfortable salary. Then give them a 12-month fellowship and see what happens.

Of course, the GNOME Foundation President can't be a kingmaker for Rust hackers in emerging economies. The Foundation should nurture the for-profit landscape of destination employers and help people find jobs where they can work on GNOME full-time --- interns and laterals, alike. Easier said than done, but it should be on the agenda.

## Events: Succession In Action

Events are an opportunity for GNOME hackers to communicate and collaborate, densely. I really enjoyed [this 5-minute intro by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLDwbhuNvZo) to the 2025 edition of the annual Clojure conference, beginning with "take a moment to reflect on the role of people." He goes on to suggest further reflection on how everyone gained the technical experience they enjoy today, as senior developers. As is standard for talks by Rich, he includes some etymology. _Confer_, the root of _conference_, literally means "to give."

An event like GUADEC is an opportunity for the old-timers to give lessons in history. It's an opportunity for them to teach skills, technical and non-technical, so that the newer generations can learn to manage and grow the GNOME community of contributors. Most of us participate in open source precisely because we want to share what we know and what we've created. We want to give. An open source conference is an opportunity to share skills about sharing.

Like every other operational procedure, the process of running a conference should be well-documented: from "Who do we contact about sponsorship?" to "Check if this year's venue has enough bandwidth for livestreaming." I've had the honour and the privilege of helping run 10-day meditation courses here in Atlantic Canada the past few years. As part of setting up our local nonprofit, we created checklist-based operations manuals for _everything._ This isn't to say that any random person could pick up our hundreds of pages of checklists and run a meditation course. They couldn't. But it does afford the management (and thus, the organization) many degrees of freedom when it comes to enlisting volunteers for help, or even rotating the managers themselves. Network resilience, remember? Clear, unambiguous documentation means there's no risk of micromanaging volunteers. As a result, volunteers don't burn out. But it also affords the organization the same succession planning tools I've discussed above.

## Advisory Board: The Old-Timer Meeting Ground

The GNOME Foundation Advisory Board has a huge amount of potential. Where the board of directors participates in governance and policy (and, at the moment, execution), the AdBoard can be one step further removed from the day-to-day of the Foundation.

The Advisory Board can, and should, act as a meeting ground for the diverse set of corporate interests. For-profits and non-profits could use the AdBoard to coordinate development efforts, synchronize on ideas and downstream release schedules, and help the Foundation find new revenue to develop GNOME and sustain itself. The AdBoard doesn't really do this today. But I don't believe it would take much effort to grow it into a powerful force for the well-being of GNOME.

Additionally, the Advisory Board could act as a landing pad for the older old-timers. Someone may be involved in GNOME at work but not have the energy or bandwidth to participate in the board or committees. If that person has decades of experience building GNOME and working with the Foundation, let them be their company's AdBoard representative. They're the perfect candidate.

## Stop The Slow Bleed

Over the past year, while reaching out to GNOME contributors, I spoke to quite a few who would tell me "I don't contribute that much anymore" or "I'm trying to avoid a particular personality online." Community members doing the Homer Simpson backwards-hedge-walk gif create a slow bleed. It's almost imperceptable, because some people already disengage from the project for months at a time under normal circumstances. But, over enough time, this slow bleed can drastically reduce the number of active GNOME hackers.

After I left in August, I had a number of people reach out to me to tell me this was the last straw after years of mismanagement. The line was usually the same: "I won't renew my Foundation membership." To them, and to you, I humbly request the oppsite:

Stay and fight.

The majority of directors on the board now see change --- healthy change --- as good for the Foundation. These changes, slow as they may have been to begin with, started long before I ever joined as ED. They continue today. Despite the strange lack of communication throughout and after August, I still firmly believe that the GNOME Foundation is the strongest it has ever been. If you have been wondering if you should stand for elections in 2026, do it. If you aren't sure if your vote matters in the elections, let me reassure you that it matters now more than ever.

If you feel, as many members do, that the Foundation and the Project have been at odds in recent years, there is a new opportunity to help the Foundation correct its course, stabilize, and grow GNOME.

Now. Just as it's the duty of the membership to improve the Foundation, it's the Foundation's responsibility to improve relationships on the project.

One of the Foundation's advisors recommended to me that the Foundation needs to learn to "release incompatible folks." I agree. The vast, _vast_ majority of GNOME contributors are lovely people doing incredible work. But sometimes problematic folks need to be asked to step away from the organization even if they aren't technically violating the Code of Conduct. Learning to have those difficult conversations is the job of Foundation management.

## Heavy Communication With Members

Because the executive is beholden to the board and the board is beholden to the membership, it is obvious (I would hope) that the executive and board should both communicate frequently and transparently with members.

I love reading [Allan's Foundation Updates](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/), a continuation of a practice we started while I was ED. Just before I left, I'd started hosting office hours. I'd also hoped to have quarterly panels. It's not possible for the ED or the President to have one-on-ones with every single Foundation member, all the time. But there should be opportunities outside of Matrix to engage in open and honest conversation.

## Financial Policy

I was very happy to see that the board [continued with the financial policy I introduced](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/foundation-budget-report-2025-26/32629). Of which, the most important aspects are the following:

* YoY balanced budget (balance recurring revenue with recurring expenses)
* Maintain the full board reserve, according to policy, without exception

I received significant pushback from one director on both of these, so it's reassuring to see the Foundation didn't backtrack after I left. I don't consider either of these policies optional in a healthy corporation.

An ex-colleague from one of my alumni networks recently asked me "what did you learn from the experience of running the GNOME Foundation?" and my response was that I left believing even more firmly what I always believed:

Run a nonprofit like any other business.

## Fiscal Controls

While I was at the Foundation, we [began the process of implementing and documenting internal controls](https://blogs.gnome.org/steven/2025/07/05/2025-07-05-foundation-update/). We had some fantastic advice from our bookkeeper and accounting advisor. I'm told these improvements are continuing and that the Foundation is incrementally tightening its financial policy.

While I was at the Foundation, we had to implement some hard limits, such as pausing the staff travel policy. With well-documented and well-enforced internal controls, austerity measures like that shouldn't have to happen again.

A close friend recently asked me about the kinds of budgets nonprofits like the GNOME Foundation and Python Software Foundation are operating under. My response was that, for any foundation incorporated in the United States at least, you could just google "Blah Foundation 990" and get a pretty clear high-level picture of any nonprofit's finances. He was shocked to see that an organization like the PSF operates with [only about $4m in revenue](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43594598). People often think of f/oss nonprofits as huge entities, like big-name tech companies, because their trademarks are so recognizable. But they aren't. Every dollar counts and every donation matters. Thus, tight fiscal controls are essential to keep costs down.

## Fundraising

Within my first few weeks at the Foundation, I "pitched" a new fundraising strategy with the twofold goal of:

* move toward recurring revenue and away from irregular, one-off cheques
* make the Foundation a grantmaker --- fund GNOME development directly

[Here is the slide deck, with sensitive/unpublished data redacted](./pdf/2025-06-03-special-meeting_compressed.pdf). (I'm guessing at least one person will note the presence of the word "openwash" and and be grossed out by that. Sorry. If you think that for-profit corporations donate to f/oss nonprofits out of altruism... I have bad news for you.)

The Executive Director doesn't need the buy-in of the board to change course on fundraising. But this was only my third week on the job and I didn't want to commit to this massive shift in the fundraising strategy without board approval. The fundraising strategy outlined in the "pitch deck" is still in place. It's working well, and covering the Foundation's current ongoing expenses, but it will take a couple years before it really bears fruit.

The first step was to build [donate.gnome.org](https://donate.gnome.org) --- the Foundation (and I) owe everything in that project to Sam Hewitt, Jakub Steiner, and Bart Piotrowski. As the landing page for donations to the Foundation, `d.g.o` is paramount in turning the Foundation around.

The second step is to make the Foundation a grantmaker, one way or another. Either to use unrestricted funds to solve an acute problem over a narrow timeframe (say, 3 months) or to provide a fellowship, similar to what the Rust Foundation used to do with their Grants Program. Or something else entirely. As long as the GNOME Foundation starts paying hackers directly with unrestricted donations, it's a grantmaker. It doesn't really matter how.

Where does the money go, though? Are donors paying for GNOME Calendar, Flatpak 2.0, or bugfixes in GNOME Online Accounts? This is tricky. The Foundation can't dictate the technical direction of the project, and that includes technical priority. But it shouldn't completely ignore the desires of donors, either. Striking a balance between [the nascent steering group](https://www.youtube.com/live/18Ir6RXkIeA?si=uwOFJUYtRga7hYTZ&t=3381) and feedback from donors would be a process of experimentation and discovery. Luckily, most corporate donors are primarily interested in _infrastructure._ They'd rather fix libraries and services than apps or GNOME Shell. So perhaps it would be natural for the Foundation's grantmaking to focus on user-visible changes which, in turn, would lead to more donations, since donors could see the positive change their donations make. A virtuous circle.

On the topic of grantmaking, I hear the board has a plan in the works to finance some GNOME development. I look forward to seeing what they come up with.

The third step is to talk about donations to GNOME. Loudly. Spend plenty of time on podcasts, YouTube, and traditional media. (Aside: Tweet-shaped social media, not so much. The rallying cry for user participation will be met with crickets on LinkedIn.) My original intention was to do this myself. Perhaps the best option with a Community Executive is to assign someone (whether they're a director of the board or not) to act as a spokesperson. Such a person would probably become synonymous with GNOME, as Miguel was once upon a time. An alternative would be to distribute this responsibility but that risks diluting the message and reducing (or never building up) the recognizability of public personas. An Executive Director is a kind of mascot --- a mouthpiece and advocate but also a lightning rod for criticism. A Community Executive probably doesn't want to take that on, so this remains one unsolved piece of the puzzle.

Public personas need to know the audience. The PR exercise of marketing GNOME's donation page will require finesse. The GNOME Foundation has a habit of preaching to the choir. It's hardly the only first-wave open source project that is stuck in this rut but messaging to donors within the community, versus GNOME's millions of users, versus corporate donors, versus government donors? Every one should highlight very different aspects. Governments care about Digital Sovereignty. Users care about features and stability. Thoughtful users will care about GNOME's infrastructure, like GitLab. GNOME hackers care about GUADEC. There isn't a lot of overlap. Red Hat employees will donate every year because they love GNOME. You don't need to win them over. Focus on the donations you _don't have._

The last step is to get Canonical to stop patching out the "Please Donate" notification in Ubuntu. I can appreciate why Canonical currently does this. Since the Foundation doesn't directly finance GNOME development yet, there's an argument to be made that Canonical isn't obligated to participate beyond their [Advisory Board membership](https://foundation.gnome.org/advisory-board). You may or may not agree with that but the way to convince Canonical that Ubuntu should support the GNOME Foundation with a "Donate" button is to demonstrate that Ubuntu users who make such donations see returns in their operating system of choice: Ubuntu. Ubuntu is built on GNOME (you might even say it's _mostly_ GNOME) so if the donations fund GNOME development directly, then everything checks out. At that point, Canonical would struggle to justify patching the notification out.

## Organizational Excellence

Hacking on GNOME has always been marked by technical excellence. It isn't a secret within the GNOME community that Foundation operations [hasn't always met the same bar](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/#planning-coordination-reporting) demanded of GNOME hackers.

Basic operating procedures, documentation, document archival policies, and financial stability are not the mark of business excellence. Everything described above is pretty basic stuff. Excellence at the Foundation will only come from reshaping the organization from the ground up.

### Feedback

It is the mark of a healthy organization that its members can engage in open and honest feedback.

I received many complaints about the Foundation even in the 3 or 4 months I spent as ED but these didn't come with any structure. Rather, they took the form of DMs or emails from members, sent directly to me, with a sampling bias for the kind of person willing to email a new ED out of the blue. The medium makes sense, when you think about it. The alternative at the time was to raise feedback in public Matrix channels, where bad faith actors lurk, or to broadcast something on Planet GNOME. There was no middle ground.

Before I left the ED post, we created a private Matrix channel for GNOME Foundation members based on a widespread desire from the membership. I also proposed creating a similar, members-only space on Discourse (this space doesn't exist yet; I'm not sure if that's seen any progress behind the scenes). Foundation members are the top of the accountability and control hierarchy --- they should have some medium to speak directly to management that sits between the high-friction world of emails and the high-visibility world of blog posts.

Perhaps more important than open communication between the membership and the board, however, is open communication between individuals. I can't count the number of times people raised complaints directly to me, about someone else.

Raising a complaint _about_ someone without first speaking to that person directly is a bizarre and unhealthy pattern of behaviour. It's not feedback, it's whining. Try not to do that. Before escalating to the ED, the board, or the CoCC, talk to the person you're having difficulty with. They may be receptive. They may not. But it's worth your effort, every time.

It is the Foundation's responsibility to help guide the community. Learning to provide feedback to someone is a skill like any other. GNOME hackers are community members like any other. This isn't an unsolvable puzzle. There are coaches, nonprofit advisory consultants, and other third parties who can help the Foundation with this process. The Foundation can't bootstrap itself out of bad habits, much less teach the community a skill most of the directors lack themselves. Thankfully, there is help out there --- and much of it is free. Also thankfully, some of the newer directors are excellent communicators and can measure whether or not a particular coach or consultant is helping the Foundation.

### Accountability

Historically, the Foundation struggled to hold its staff, directors, and officers accountable for patterns of broken behaviour. I am not referring to one-off mistakes: a forgotten task, a momentary lack of judgment, or a dropped ball. _Patterns of behaviour_ are marked by repeatedly failing to deliver: repeatedly failing to own a task, project, or strategy from start to finish.

This situation is improving now, bit by bit.

Just as there are two scales to the Foundation (the board and the staff), there are two scales to accountability. Staff need to be held accountable for work at the task or project level. "I told you about this a month ago." is the canonical antipattern. Did this person follow up? Was there a clear delineation of responsibility? Was everyone clear on what needed to be accomplished, and by when? There are Staff, Infrastructure, and Board project walls in GitLab to track who's owning what. The board needs to be held accountable for work at the strategic level: what are the goals of the organization for this year? Five years? Ten years? Is the ED ensuring that we meet those goals? Last, the ED needs to be held accountable for both. The ED helps the board decide on strategy and enables the staff to execute on it. In an organization as small as the GNOME Foundation, the ED will be executing on a lot of tasks herself, directly. Such a small organization has no choice but to operate cross-functionally.

The GNOME Foundation board, at the top of this hierarchy, is a "working board" (in the sense that they are heavily involved in the day-to-day operation of the business) and a 9-person board can make accountability too diffuse. As a result, it's useful for the membership to narrow in on board leadership when evaluating the board's performance. The timescales are long but, thankfully, board elections only happen once a year. This May, I strongly encourage you (if you are a member) to retrospect on the past five years. There were some significant leadership changes in August of 2025 and if you have concerns about the Foundation's legacy strategies, provide that feedback to the new board so they can learn from past mistakes.

Importantly, there exist patterns of behaviour which override delivery. If someone exhibits a low-integrity pattern of behaviour, year after year, they need to be held accountable and removed from the project. It does not matter if this person writes mountains of code, brings in big donor cheques, has been with the project for decades, or happens to be your best friend. Your responsibility as 501(c)(3) management is to the institution, not your friendships. This is all the more true when such a person's pattern of behaviour is not only low-integrity, but abusive. Bullies should not be tolerated.

### Reputations, Bullies, Abuse, and Violence

Human psychology tends to lump people into two camps. The good guys and the bad guys. The righteous and the wretched. Princess Zelda and Ganon. We love these simple narratives because they're easier to digest. But they do not help us maintain safe communities.

First, let's talk about _People With A Reputation._ It will surprise no one that there are a couple _personalities_ within the GNOME community. I sometimes heard these folks described as "having a reputation" or "a bit prickly."

At times, grumpy behaviour may require the board's attention. Generally, though, this category of behaviour is why the Code of Conduct Committee exists, if it's functioning correctly.

Second, let's talk about the actual _Bullies and Abusers._ While I was at the GNOME Foundation, I witnessed patterns of both bullying and abuse. These rarely come from the "usual suspects", described above. As is the case in any relationship, abusers are often very skilled at concealing their behaviour. They usually aren't the loudest personalities, or the most visible.

While I was in the ED role, I dealt with the bullying I witnessed as best I could. After I left, I informed the board about what I saw (and what I experienced myself). I have the privilege and the bandwidth to stand up to abusive behaviour. So I'm doing that. Every time someone escapes consequences for their abusive behaviour, it emboldens them to do so again in the future. Especially if those abusive people are in positions of power, those of us who can act, need to act.

Abusive behaviour is not the responsibility of the CoCC. It is the responsibility of the board, with the help of a real lawyer.

Third, I want to talk about _Violence._ The internet can be a dangerous place. When I wrote [_On Safety_](https://blogs.gnome.org/steven/2025/05/28/on-safety/), I was addressing this risk: real, physical safety. When the risks associated with someone cross this line, it is the role of the Foundation to enlist the help of lawyers and law enforcement. It is not the time to push back ourselves, as individuals. There have been criminal attacks on the GNOME community, from outside. Let the law deal with these.

[My keynote story about anger](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?si=9o1pvAEyJfxhdzch&t=376) attempted, in a fumbling way, to address these three categories: the grouch, the bully, and the criminal. Although sometimes intermingled, these three patterns of behaviour are not equivalent. It is the Foundation's role to address each one with the appropriate corrective action.

### Transparency

"Transparency" is a term that somehow manages to confuse a lot of people. As a consequence, people debate the merits of transparency, with each side of the argument grounded in their own confusion.

Back in 2016, I gave a CreativeMornings talk about [our transparency strategy at Nilenso](https://youtu.be/0sUMbqdHhME). (Apologies for two things: First, yes, I'm presenting on a Mac. 2016 Nilenso had a lot of Macs in the office and that happened to be the computer available. Second, I'm sorry the acoustics of that building were horrible.) You can go and watch the talk if you want, but tl;dw -

* transparency lives on a spectrum --- it's not binary
* the word "transparency" in the context of organizations refers to _reducing the chance of corruption_
* transparency reduces corruption by merit of being "read-write", not "read-only" --- observing the thing changes the thing

The Foundation will benefit from transparency. _A lot more_ transparency. Private, members-only conversation channels help with this. [Foundation Updates](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/) help with this. Fresh blood in leadership positions at the Foundation helps with this. But every one of these is really just the beginning. The Foundation will achieve excellence, in my opinion, when it finds an optimal balance in the act of sharing the majority of its strategy, execution, and operation with the membership --- in a way that is easy to digest and receptive to feedback.

The word "balance" here is key. It does not make the GNOME Foundation "transparent" if everyone can read every line item in the organization's accounting history, see what every contractor is being paid, or record every board meeting on video and publish it to YouTube. Spreading every little detail out on the table just creates a firehose of information no one can keep up with, which would only act as a magnet for trolls.

Other organizations indulge the firehose, and that's fine. Buffer [publishes its employees salaries](https://buffer.com/open). The postmarketOS team [publish a financial transparency report](https://postmarketos.org/blog/2025/12/19/contributor-compensantion-and-financial-update/) that links to spreadsheets. These are extreme examples. The GNOME Foundation can't go this far, in part because it needs to consider the safety of staff and the sanity of its directors.

It's also important to consider that different layers of the organization require transparency at different scales. The membership, the board, the executive, the staff, the wider hacker community, and the general public all produce and consume information at different rates and at different volumes. With a Community Executive, the Foundation enjoys fewer layers to contend with and transparency as a function of public relations is simplified. That's a good thing.

The value of increased transparency will be immense. Transparency --- especially transparency at the right scale, granularity, and volume, targetting the right audience --- will rebuild the community's trust in the Foundation. Members will then be more likely to participate, which in turn will lead to more vibrant elections, which in turn will lead to higher transparency by community osmosis. Another virtuous circle.

### Board of Directors

Some day in the future, _too many_ people will run for board elections. When that happens, it will clearly signal that the Foundation is healing. It should be an honour to sit on the board of directors. And it will be, eventually.

This is one aspect of the Foundation I had backward, initially. When I joined in May, I tried as hard as I could to recruit candidates with accounting, legal, governance, and management backgrounds. _"Just because someone has mastered Rust and GTK doesn't make them a great director,"_ I thought. And while that's true, just because someone has a management background doesn't make them a great director, either.

In my brief experience, the strongest directors have been those with an unwavering and contemporary commitment to GNOME. They aren't on the board to boost their own organization's standing and they aren't there to twist the knife on petty grievances. Good directors sit on the board because they want to see GNOME stronger in 2056 than it is in 2026. Good directors put in the work. Good directors tackle conflict head-on and have the difficult conversations.

Hackers can absolutely make great directors.

One of the biggest changes I would like to see is a representative from Canonical on the GNOME Foundation board. Canonical has Advisory Board representatives but very few Canonical employees even seem to have Foundation membership. Step one: get your Ubuntu friends a Foundation membership! Step two: get at least one Ubuntu Desktop person on the board. You folks are in this together. Team up for real.

### Policy Governance

I spoke about [Policy Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Governance) in [my GUADEC 2025 keynote](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?t=1286). As I mentioned in the intro, I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day for my 3 or 4 months at the Foundation. I really enjoyed working with Allan and I believe that, generally, we agreed on how the Foundation should operate. Since the day I left, he's been doing an excellent job of leading the Foundation.

Policy Governance is the one place where Allan and I differed in opinion. He's been around both GNOME and the Foundation for much longer, so perhaps he knows better. He has expressed the opinion that the board's heavy involvement in the Foundation's operation is a good thing. I tend to disagree. I believe a high level of involvement from the Executive Committee in a 501(c)(3) is an antipattern, indicative of cash flow issues, a failure of management, or a failure of operations --- or all three.

That said, the current Community Executive situation is perhaps the best possible outcome in 2026. If the board and the Executive Committee are going to be deeply involved in the operation of the Foundation anyway, lean in. I will admit that a Community Executive has distinct advantages: it saves money, it unifies the management strategy, and it brings the board (and thus, the membership) closer to the day-to-day operations of the Foundation which, in turn, should ensure the Foundation satisfies its mission and the desires of the membership. A Community Executive also benefits from decades of GNOME experience.

Finding a competent staff executive for the Foundation isn't just structurally difficult. It's also financially difficult: By some funky coincidence, my salary offer for the ED position was exactly 50% of my salary from _back in 2010,_ to the dollar. It paid my rent. I wasn't a volunteer. But it wasn't a director-level salary, either. Since I knew how to google "gnome foundation 990", I didn't bother negotiating. I joined the Foundation to help, not squeeze blood from a stone.

Unless the board can scrounge together a normal executive salary, a staff executive will need to have the same passion for the Linux desktop experience that GNOME contributors have and, if possible, experience working with the GNOME community. Although not impossible, that's a tall order. For the time-being, a Community Executive makes a lot of sense.

Perhaps, years in the future, the board _will_ choose to hire another staff executive. If and when they do, I still believe that Policy Governance will be their friend and I will continue to advocate for it along those timelines.

### Shift to Infrastructure

With a vanishingly small staff, the GNOME Foundation needs anchors to maintain ownership of its most important tooling. Directors will come and go. Someone needs to hold down the fort over a longer window of time.

The peculiar advantage of a software-focused nonprofit is the same operational advantage of for-profit software companies: automation and infrastructure. [New finance platforms](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2026/01/16/gnome-foundation-update-2026-01-16/) are being put in place at the Foundation, which is excellent. While I was there, we moved all banking ownership from the accounting function of the organization to the treasury function (the President and Treasurer). This is the correct alignment of tooling and access for the Foundation's finances, and both of these adjustments represent a wonderful step forward.

Beyond this, however, I firmly believe all non-banking tools should move under the umbrella of the GNOME Foundation's [Infrastructure Team](https://handbook.gnome.org/infrastructure.html). This includes payment processors, ForEx tooling, contract software, SaaS accounts, and so on. The selfless efforts of Andrea and Bart over the years have shown them to be some of the most loyal and trustworthy actors across the GNOME Foundation. I have never seen either of them act politically, or with ill will. In a nonprofit apocalypse, when everything else falls apart, they are the ones who will keep the lights on, whether they're paid for it or not.

That said, network resilience applies just as much to Infrastructure as it does to everything else. Andrea is in the Americas and Bart's in Europe. It would be lovely to find someone in Asia to join the team so all timezones are covered. That person needs to prove themselves to be equally trustworthy, though.

We trust the Infrastructure Team with root on all the servers for good reason. Other than bank accounts, trust them with the other core tooling, too.

### Diversity

Although GNOME is an upstream project, it feels to me like it is at risk from a lack of corporate diversity. The Red Hat Desktop team does amazing work but GNOME benefits from diversification of downstreams. It would be lovely to see heavier involvement from the Ubuntu Desktop folks --- not just on the board, but everywhere. There are other downstream software and hardware players, too. The more companies that get involved in GNOME, the healthier GNOME will be. This is just network resilience again, for software bus factor.

Financially, the Foundation itself will benefit from diversified revenue streams. I hear that the new user donation platform is moving along smoothly. Yay! Next, Foundation management needs to dovetail those donations from individuals into larger donations from corporate donors. (And the Foundation's good friends at the PSF and OpenSSL Foundation have great advice in this area.) It's not just about money. As a 501(c)(3), the GNOME Foundation needs to pass a [Public Support Test](https://www.501c3.org/understanding-the-501c3-public-support-test/) every year. As Jef Spaleta, the Fedora project lead, put it: "more individual donors raise the ceiling on how many big donations the Foundation can receive... everybody wins." In the same way that many small donations from individuals are better, a large number of medium-sized donations from corporations is preferable to one or two large cheques every year.

Culturally, GNOME is very [safe](https://web.archive.org/web/20251012011628/https://blogs.gnome.org/steven/2025/05/28/on-safety/) and inviting, which is fantastic. GNOME benefits from a broader base of contributors, from all walks of life. This isn't just a case of "more hackers = better". Growing communities for the long term in locations outside of Berlin and Boston will ensure GNOME's longevity and vibrance. [GNOME Nepal](https://nepal.gnome.org/) is the perfect example of how to execute on this: start small and humbly, embrace the local community, and tackle challenges head-on. GNOME Nepal is walking the long arc from the baby steps of growing Linux adoption to the hard work of onboarding new contributors. That kind of effort takes years and requires someone like Aaditya to have the vision _and_ execute on it. The GNOME Foundation Infrastructure Team has done a fantastic job of supporting GNOME Nepal. I hope the management team will use GNOME Nepal as a template for growing GNOME in other parts of the world.

In the long term, broadening the base will mean bringing more app developers into GNOME. Show mid- to senior-level developers the joys of GTK and Libadwaita. Get people excited about the Linux desktop again. I hear it's making a comeback.

## A Ball of Yarn

It was widely understood that the GNOME Foundation was in trouble before I applied for the role of ED. Google "gnome foundation" in conjunction with any choice phrase: "problems", "steps down", "tough times", that sort of thing. [Here's my cover letter](/pdf/2024-12-04-gnome-foundation-ed.pdf), which has always been public. I wasn't shy about the fact that I knew the GNOME Foundation needed to undergo some fundamental change, and fast. That was why they hired me.

I list [my job titles on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-deobald/) as "janitor" for a reason. I love this stuff.

Before I interviewed for the ED role, I asked Holly and Richard to tell me about their experiences and strategic thinking as the prior Executive Directors. I had a very consistent picture painted in most of my interviews: there are financial troubles and there are people troubles. When I joined? Sure enough. Financial troubles and people troubles.

As one outgoing director put it, "even solving the biggest and most obvious problem only treats a symptom --- the problems are systemic." Systemic problems require systematic solutions because an organization is a system like any other. It's a puzzle to be solved. For 5 months, my visualization was that of a ball of yarn. Pull at a thread. Pull, pull, pull until it comes loose. Then pull at another thread. And another. And another. Repeat until the ball is untangled.

The current board is untangling that ball of yarn. Some of the threads represent broken processes, some represent unhealthy relationships, and others represent flawed execution. Regardless of the immediate problem in front of them, the board is employing systematic solutions, just as I did. They're smart folks and they're doing a brilliant job. But a lot of the board's work is hard to see and it's a big ball of yarn. So please be patient with them.

## The Future

The strategy laid out in this document describes what might be a 5- to 10-year plan. There will be difficult and ongoing conversations to be had about how to invest the Foundation's newfound revenue back into GNOME development.

Beyond the Foundation's core mission, I believe there are a few remaining places the organization can lead in the world of f/oss nonprofits.

The first is to embrace other Free Software organizations: [third-wave open source](https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2024-08-13-third-wave-commercial-open-source/) companies, newer nonprofits like [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/), hardware manufacturers who believe in [open hardware](https://frame.work/) as much as open source, and governments who are willing to [acknowledge the lies of the old world order](https://youtu.be/flsgJe8mN-A?t=154) and now look for cooperative, sovereign technology alternatives.

The second is, over time, to untether the Foundation from legacy f/oss nonprofit social networks and embrace new ones. It's not 1997 anymore and I have not witnessed these old social networks benefitting GNOME. While I was ED, other Executive Directors and CEOs in the Free Software world repeatedly described these old networks to me with a single, ugly word: "incestuous." There are millions of skilled people out there to hire. The only advantage to hiring "in network" is the false sense of security it brings. Get new people excited instead of going to the same well over and over. Find new donors. Attend conferences other than (or at least in addition to) the usuals like FOSDEM and SCALE.

Last, I believe the Foundation will have to move to Europe. This isn't a near-term goal. The Foundation still has an incredible amount of work to do before its head is above water, and even more work before it achieves its deserved excellence on par with the GNOME project it serves. Only once the Foundation is financially sound, stable, and serving its mission of building GNOME should it uproot itself and jump the Atlantic.

My reason for recommending that the Foundation shift to Europe is probably not the one you are thinking of. American administrations come and go, just like directors of a nonprofit board come and go. The current state of the USA won't be its political landscape forever. No, the problem I see with incorporating entities in the United States lives somewhere between law and culture. The expected behaviours in an American office are no longer in alignment with the rest of the world. This is exacerbated by legal frameworks which seem absurd to Europeans, Indians, and Canadians like me. America's idiotic culture war penetrates its institutions, including its nonprofits. The GNOME Foundation needs to focus on its mission: GNOME. Europe will be the best place to do that, in the long term.

Maybe after all that is accomplished, the membership can unleash the Design Team on the foot.

## Now What?

I don't expect the GNOME Foundation board to treat the recommendations above as prescriptive. I'm not even sure they'll read this document. But every one of these recommendations is available à la carte, and I hope they are useful both individually and in terms of their interdependencies. I also hope they are useful to the community when future Foundation members become board members and when the membership becomes increasingly involved in Foundation operations.

In spite of the weird lack of communication during the first two weeks of August, I will reiterate my opinion that, as of August 2025, the Foundation is the strongest it's been in a decade. It has gotten stronger every month. We balanced the budget. We corrected the treasury function of the organization. The board is learning to cut costs and control spending. Most of the board's acting directors now want what's best for GNOME. The Foundation is well on its way to fulfilling its mission.

GNOME Foundation 2.0 will happen whether it relies on my advice or not. It has to happen. GNOME Foundation 1.0 was completely unsustainable. I do believe the GNOME Foundation is changing for the better. That change isn't easy. There will be growing pains along the way.

The Foundation's [bylaws](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/foundation-web/-/raw/1312bc359e661de6c114a34bd3c77434032a9d38/foundation.gnome.org/about/bylaws.pdf) saddle Allan with the Acting Executive Director role, just as Robert McQueen [was Acting Executive Director](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Infrastructure/foundation-web/-/blob/b2631b950cc6126262cf9659d6527c3d8f364e2a/foundation.gnome.org/about/bylaws.html#L883) for the vast majority of the preceding 5 years while he was President. Allan's vision for the Foundation isn't the same as my vision, and that's fine. My ideas aren't important. The important thing is that the people at the helm love GNOME and are willing to put their egos aside to ensure the Foundation is a success. In my 25-year career, I don't think I've ever seen the kind of commitment that Allan has to GNOME. The Foundation is in good hands.

There's a mountain of work to do and the new board is taking it in stride under Allan's leadership, but they could use your help. If you are a GNOME Foundation member and you want to volunteer, ask the board how you can be of service.

GNOME Foundation 2.0 is around the corner and there's never been a better time to get involved. ❤️
