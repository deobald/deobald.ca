[Like Nick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR_Uzf2B-YA&t=106s), I had no idea what happened back in August. I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day throughout my 3.5 months at the Foundation. Immediately following GUADEC, Allan went on vacation for a couple weeks and during that time the board held a few meetings I wasn't invited to. On August 13th, Robert McQueen called me to tell me I "wasn't a good fit." The board's half of the decision was never discussed with me and their decision was never explained. I think (hope?) that Allan was as surprised as I was when he returned from vacation on August 18th. My agreement to step down was largely due to the total lack of communication from the board at that time. People joke about an Executive Director having "nine bosses", which is its own kind of challenge. That challenge really deepens if your bosses don't speak to you.

I still don't know what happened in August. I probably never will. If the board opts to hire a staff Executive Director in the future, I sincerely hope they learn to talk through problems openly first.

Quick note: As a condition of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign [_One Of Those Things_](https://youtu.be/NUC2EQvdzmY). However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation, its staff, and its directors --- past and present. If the comment above, or any of the strategy below, reads critically, rest assured my only interest is in helping the Foundation continue to grow into its next 25 years.

I didn't publish a strategy while I was in the ED role because if there was one thing I heard from every corner of the community it was "DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES." I took this to heart and generally only spoke about the work the team accomplished once the work was already done.

I'm publishing a strategy now because (a) it's been four months since I left, which is roughly how long I was there and (b) I want the board's Community Executive to have this blueprint, regardless of whether they make use of it or not.

This strategy hinges on two broad conceptual shifts in how the GNOME Foundation operates:

1. Focus On The Mission
2. Build An Institution

There's quite a bit of detail beneath this, but these two ideals provide a useful framework upon which the community executive can ask themselves these questions, from time to time: "Are we focusing on the mission?" and "Are we building an institution?"

## Focus On The Mission

It is illegal for the GNOME Foundation to pursue any initiative other than it's 501(c)(3) mission, as declared on its Form 990 that it submits to the IRS. As of 2025, that mission is as follows:

> The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.

[As recently as the 2024 IRS  submission](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43572618), the mission statement was actually a bit clearer in its intent:

> GNOME Foundation provides charitable community benefit by broadening access to technology through the development and distribution of a usable free computer desktop software to people in countries around the world for whom operable computers would otherwise have been unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

...but I'm guessing most of us can agree that both mission statements are equally applicable and that the activity the GNOME Foundation was incorporated to engage in is "build a Free Software desktop", where "free" takes both meanings and "desktop" also applies to rectangle form-factor computers like laptops and phones.

In short, the GNOME Foundation exists to support the development of GNOME. Nothing else.

### Care Must Be Taken

It is important that directors of the board do not get bogged down in other well-meaning initiatives.

As of 2026, for better or for worse, the GNOME Foundation is incorporated in the United States. There are many concepts or initiatives we, in other countries, take for granted as positive forces for society. In the United States (especially under its current administration), most of these are still hot-button political issues. No matter how useful, positive, or wholesome such an initiative may be, the GNOME Foundation cannot legally pursue that initiative under its charter. The Foundation doesn't exist to solve climate change, eliminate poverty, end genocide, or fight human rights violations. It cannot legally do those things. Nor should it --- a tiny organization like the GNOME Foundation cannot solve all of humanity's problems.

I am of the opinion that the Python Software Foundation strikes the right balance, here. Back in October, they [withdrew from a $1.5m USA government grant](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html) that they were almost guaranteed to win because the terms violated their ethics and betrayed the trust of their community. This is the kind of principled stance the GNOME Foundation can and should still make. The PSF is a brilliant role model based on this one example alone.

The purpose of the GNOME Foundation is to provide a trustworthy, sustainable, accessible Free Software ecosystem to everyone --- in every country --- while stewarding a safe, welcoming community.

Do that.

### Fill In The Gaps

While it's quaint to suggest that [fundraising via Friends of GNOME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptltPdcXH0Q) pays for most of GNOME, there isn't a single GNOME Foundation member who believes this. The vast majority of GNOME's development comes from the hard work of folks at companies like Red Hat and Igalia. The majority of them get paid full-time to work on GNOME and then spend their evenings and weekends on their favourite hobby: hacking on GNOME.

The rest of GNOME's development comes from volunteers, unrestricted grants, and contract work. The massive effort enabled by the [STF contract](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/) is a recent example.

To my knowledge, the GNOME Foundation has only ever engaged in the act of software development via _restricted_ grants. This includes [work on GTK from 2018 to 2021](TODO: link), and work on Digital Wellbeing and GLib in recent years. There's absolutely nothing wrong with restricted grants and hopefully the Foundation continues to receive such grants.

However, for the GNOME Foundation to fulfill its nonprofit mission, I believe its role is to "fill in the gaps." Companies like Red Hat and Canonical only have so many degrees of freedom --- the software they write will, generally, try to make their customers happy. That's just... how you run a company. But there are times when commercial incentives won't get certain software built. GNOME Calendar is, arguably, the most beautiful calendar app out there --- but it lacks essential features because it's 100% volunteer-built. GNOME's accessibility (#a11y) story gets better every release --- but major gaps exist, even in 2026. The diagram that follows is a doodle I created for the Fundraising Committee when I left:

![Filling The Gaps](/img/2025-12-31-gnome-foundation-fill-gaps.png)

[The entire diagram](https://excalidraw.com/#json=iK8q_5x5MhX-lmhrk_xuA,nuZy0yO7SIcW0b9ExI6QhA) can be seen on Excalidraw. This largely covers my outreach and fundraising strategy, but I'm happy to answer questions about it if anyone has them. There's nothing new in there. It's mostly stuff I've said in my blog, GUADEC 2025 keynote, or in public Matrix channels... but it puts it all in one place.

## Build An Institution

I've had a lot to say about building institutions over the years. Most recently, [I spoke about this on the Lifestyle Democracy Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/lifestyle-democracy/episodes/the-future-of-tech-worker-cooperatives-institutions-not-star). I've been beating the same dead horse... er, drum... for years now: if you build a corporation but that corporation dies with you, then you haven't built anything at all.

This applies even more acutely to nonprofits than it does to for-profit companies. There is no such thing as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit "family business." The institution is everything.

### Succession Planning

Succession planning (sometimes called _continuity planning_) is essential in competent governance, regardless of corporate structure. But in a nonprofit, it's all the more important because of the additional layers of oversight. In a 501(c)(3), that includes scrutiny from both the IRS and the Attorney General. Continuity planning is a component of every director's fiduciary duty to the corporation.

While I was in the ED role, I think people were surprised that I didn't shy away from the topic of death. Americans, in particular, seemed bothered by this. (It was once even demanded of me that I refrain from using the term "bus factor.") I did avoid the topic with the two Americans who requested it of me. I [provided content warnings](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?si=eafOWsUprdsQhwY3&t=46) in group contexts. But the fact that more than one person raised the issue with me led me to reflect on the topic more deeply in the autumn.

I lost a first cousin last year. He was two days my senior. My brother went through six months of intense chemo this year. (He's doing fine now.) I've considered death a lot in the past two years, even if subconsciously.

Consciously, however, I don't think the topic can be avoided by anyone with the maturity to build a corporation which must outlive them. Inherently, the topic of succession planning includes emergency succession. With the Covid-19 pandemic barely behind us, it's easy to forget that [nonprofits and for-profits alike were scrambling to construct succession plans](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348417640_Revitalising_Organisations'_Emergency_Succession_Planning_in_the_Face_of_the_Covid-19_Outbreak) not that long ago. The nonprofit space is very supportive, and there was [plenty of simple, easy-to-understand advice](https://blueavocado.org/leadership-and-management/how-to-plan-and-execute-an-emergency-succession/) for creating succession plans during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The GNOME Foundation needs a succession plan.


### Nurture The Next Generation

Every aspect of GNOME needs to encourage and grow the next generation of contributors, not just the Foundation. The Design Team does a great job of this and I hope they don't mind me calling them out. The Core Design Team is kind of broken down by generation: old farts like Jakub and Allan, the middle generation like Sam and Tobias, and the young folks like Jamie and Kramo. I've attended Design Team meetings. They're a productive and mindful group. I have little doubt that mindfulness is a large part of them considering how to ensure GNOME's design doesn't stagnate and that no one becomes a Single Point of Failure (SPOF).

[Emmanuele talked about creating a steering group](https://www.youtube.com/live/18Ir6RXkIeA?si=uwOFJUYtRga7hYTZ&t=3381) at GUADEC 2025. The board and staff are loosening some of these knots. Knowledge-sharing and [pairing up on Officer roles](https://handbook.gnome.org/foundation/board-of-directors/officers.html) is a great way to unstick the Foundation's legacy processes. Pushing the staff to become cross-functional is another. This work has begun. It just needs to continue.

For the avoidance of doubt, I'll call out explicitly: "continuity planning" never refers to "continuity" by way of keeping the same person in the same role indefinitely. If we were immortal (and if someone were willing to work the same job for hundreds of years), we could plan this way. Since we are not, the "continuity" we're planning for is a transition: from one person or one group of people to another person or another group of people.

I bring this up because different corners of the GNOME Foundation (and the GNOME project) seem to view this from different angles. We shouldn't confuse consistency with continuity.

Keeping one person in the same role without redundancy for years and years also has a tendency to cause gatekeeping. We all fall victim to the habit of gatekeeping, even unconsciously. And it has a tendency to perpetuate itself: if I'm the only person who's done a job for 5 years, I'm bound to start believing I'm the _only_ person who can do that job. Of course this is never true, so it's always a good idea to make sure at least one other person understands how you do your job.

### Committee Rotation

Every committee should experience some amount of rotation, every year. Most do, with one notable exception: the Code of Conduct Committee.

Given that this was the only committee I ever received complaints about as Executive Director (many complaints, from most corners of the community), I strongly encourage the board to heavily rotate the Code of Conduct Committee, as soon as they have the bandwidth to do so. They can probably start by documenting the entrance criteria: how does someone join the CoCC? Currently, that's unclear.

The board would be well-served with a policy on committee rotation for all committees, to prevent stagnation.

### Slow Board Rotation

Paradoxically, I would love to see the board _slow_ its rotation. Prior to Holly Million's appointment as ED, the board would sometimes rotate in its entirety _every single year._ Holly, with her nonprofit experience, helped the board plug that hole. However, when I asked past directors if they would be willing to re-join the board, I would hear this, in an exhausted voice: "if I'm asked to serve, I can."

Serving on the board should be neither a luxury, nor a chore. It should strike a balance between the serious work of governance and avoiding burnout. Ideally, elections should decide when a board member is rotated out. At the moment, barely enough members run for elections to fill the available seats. I had to coax all four candidates in the 2025 elections to run.

A slower board rotation would indicate a few things: It would indicate that the work is no longer soul-crushing. It would indicate that the membership is actually happy with the work the Foundation does. It would indicate that the directors are getting comfortable with the few small operational tasks required of a working board in an organization of this scale.

Combining succession planning with slower board rotation, the outcome should be healthy evolution: the longest-serving board members are asked to step out of Officer roles and, eventually, bow out of the board.

### Documentation

When I joined the GNOME Foundation, there was no operational or executive documentation to speak of. This was, in part, a tooling problem: the Foundation had jumped between wikis and GitLab and Nextcloud and Google Docs on multiple occasions. Still, 25 years is a long time to go without even basic SOPs. While I was there, Bart and Andrea created a single, private, go-to Sphinx instance in the style of [https://handbook.gnome.org](https://handbook.gnome.org) --- I sincerely hope this is still going and that the board is incrementally fleshing it out.

Clear documentation, centralized at a single location, is how the Foundation will manage its people transitions. Hand-offs are great, but board members and staff alike should have a single README-style document from which they can find everything else they need to keep the Foundation running smoothly.

I should clarify that non-operational processes were well documented: board policies, accounting practices (courtesy Rebecca the bookkeeper), and infrastructure documentation (courtesy Bart and Andrea). But even these need to be discoverable, which is where the Foundation Handbook comes in. If someone has a question about infrastructure, their first port of call should be a document linked from the Handbook, not waking up Andrea in the middle of the night.

Once the Foundation's documentation has started to tighten up, it would be wise to implement a document archival and retention policy designed for the long term. We began this work while I was ED and managed to get all of the Foundation's historical documents into Nextcloud, but there's still quite a bit of work to do in terms of making the archival process repeatable and discoverable for new officers and staff.

### Network Resilience

If you paid much attention to the things I was saying in the spring and summer of 2025, you definitely heard me speak about "network resilience." Documentation is a part of that resilience but redundancy carries more weight. Documentation can get out of date. Documentation requires that the author write in such a way that the reader doesn't misinterpret what is being said.

The advantage that human redundancy carries over documentation is that it directly represents the truth on the ground. A Deputy Executive Director has access to, and understands, all of the work of the Executive Director. An involved Vice President is familiar with the strategy and policy of the President.

Helpfully, redundancy in every role ensures the documentation remains up-to-date. If the Foundation needs to execute some mundane-but-essential task, like [renewing the trademark](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2026/01/09/gnome-foundation-update-2026-01-09/), have the less-experienced person execute by following the documentation, while pairing with the more experienced person. Pairing on these kinds of slow-cycle tasks while following the documentation will lead to the usual brand of insightful questions, such as "Do we still have the same trademark lawyer we had 10 years ago?" and "Has international trademark law changed significantly, causing us to require registration in a new jurisdiction?"

## Grow The Community

The GNOME Foundation's responsibility is to the community. The membership. This makes it the Foundation's responsibility to grow the membership. This can happen in many ways.

First, and this is a personal preference, I would love to see a greater focus on app developers. Every janky JavaScript framework cooked up in a weekend has a very lightweight _Quickstart_ document. While [developer.gnome.org](https://developer.gnome.org/) does have Beginner Tutorials, it doesn't have a short document that assumes the reader already knows half a dozen programming languages and just wants to get from zero to Baby's First Adwaita App in under 3 minutes. Writing documentation can be a joy (I personally loved writing [docs.endatabas.com](https://docs.endatabas.com/tutorial/quickstart)) but it's a chore more often than not. Where the developer.gnome.org has gaps, the Foundation should help flesh those out. I believe a Quickstart (short enough to be printed on an A4) would be a great place to start.

I'll pause here to explain part of why I think this is so important. It's not a beef with the current GNOME docs; they're quite lovely. The importance is capturing the moment. Desktop Linux is going gangbusters. Meanwhile, every senior dev and their cat is trying to think of an app to build on top of local-first tech. Many (most?) of the people switching to Linux are, themselves, developers. A lot of those developers will just [do what Linus does](https://youtu.be/mfv0V1SxbNA?si=yte6DTa9MMuOdHSj&t=2711) and install Fedora. They will probably run GNOME. If they want to spend a weekend tossing together a D&D campaign manager, recipe app, or the perfect local-first todo list app for their workflow, the Foundation should encourage that. Native app development on Linux is _fun_ and _addictive._ Good quickstart docs are the gateway drug, and they're cheap to make.

Second to the app developer focus comes a focus on platform developers. From the Foundation's perspective, this effort is twofold: to pay developers directly to work on the platform and then to encourage corporate diversity (ctrl+f for "diversity" to read more on what I mean by that) so up-and-coming platform devs have a soft landing.

Paying platform developers means more than internships. While internships are a wonderful way to encourage inexperienced folks to build their skills and contribute to open source, they have a pretty low historical hit rate of keeping people in f/oss ecosystems. Why? Because everyone needs to eat. If there aren't jobs in GNOME tech after an internship finishes, a GNOME intern is just going to get gobbled up writing Yet Another React App or some cloud-native doodad in Go. It's not 1997. You can't assume these folks are going to sacrifice every evening and weekend for open source anymore.

Instead, it's preferable to find someone who would be a "lateral hire" in a regular company. The global income gap sucks in just about every way... except for this. If you have $1500/mo to spend on maintaining GLib, find a C hacker in a developing economy for whom that's a comfortable salary. Then give them a 12-month fellowship and see what happens.

Of course, the GNOME Foundation President can't be a kingmaker for Rust hackers in emerging economies. The Foundation should nurture the for-profit landscape of destination employers and help people find jobs where they can work on GNOME full-time --- interns and laterals, alike.

## Events

Events are an opportunity for GNOME hackers to communicate and collaborate, densely. I really enjoyed [this 5-minute intro by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLDwbhuNvZo) to the 2025 edition of the annual Clojure conference, beginning with "take a moment to reflect on the role of people." He goes on to suggest further reflection on where everyone gained the technical experience they enjoy today, as senior developers. As is standard for talks by Rich, he includes some etymology. _Confer_, the root of _conference_, literally means "to give."

An event like GUADEC is an opportunity for the old-timers to provide history. It's an opportunity for them to teach skills, technical and non-technical, so that the newer generations can learn to manage and grow the GNOME community of contributors. Most of us participate in open source precisely because we want to share what we know and what we've created. An open source conference is an opportunity to share skills about sharing.

Like every other operational procedure, the process of running a conference should be well-documented: from "Who do we contact about sponsorship?" to "Check if this year's venue have enough bandwidth for livestreaming." I've had the honour and the privilege of helping run 10-day meditation courses here in Atlantic Canada the past few years. As part of setting up our local nonprofit, we created checklist-based operations manuals for _everything._ This isn't to say that any random person could pick up our hundreds of pages of checklists and run a meditation course. They couldn't. But it does afford the management (and thus, the organization) many degrees of freedom when it comes to enlisting volunteers for help, or even rotating the managers themselves. Network resilience, remember? Clear, unambiguous documentation means there's no risk of micromanaging volunteers. As a result, volunteers don't burn out. But it also affords the organization the same succession planning tools I've discussed above.

## Advisory Board

The GNOME Foundation Advisory Board has a huge amount of potential. Where the board of directors participates in governance and policy (and, at the moment, execution), the AdBoard can be one step further removed from the day-to-day of the Foundation.

The Advisory Board can, and should, act as a meeting ground for the diverse set of corporate interests. For-profits and non-profits could use the AdBoard to coordinate development efforts, synchronize on ideas and downstream release schedules, and help the Foundation find new revenue to develop GNOME and sustain itself. The AdBoard doesn't really do this today. But I don't believe it would take much effort to grow it into a powerful force for the well-being of GNOME.

Additionally, the Advisory Board could act as a landing pad for the older old-timers. Someone may be involved in GNOME at work but not have the energy or bandwidth to participate in the board or committees. If that person has decades of experience building GNOME and working with the Foundation, let them be their company's AdBoard representative. They're the perfect candidate.

## Stop The Slow Bleed

Over the past year, while reaching out to GNOME contributors, I spoke to quite a few who would tell me "I don't contribute that much anymore" or "I'm trying to avoid a particular personality online." Community members doing the Homer Simpson backwards-hedge-walk gif create a slow bleed. It's almost imperceptable, because some people already disengage from the project for months at a time. But, over enough time, this slow bleed can drastically reduce the number of active GNOME hackers.

After I left in August, I had a number of people reach out to me to tell me this was the last straw after years of mismanagement. The line was usually the same: "I won't renew my Foundation membership." To them, and to you, I humbly request the oppsite:

Stay and fight.

The majority of directors on the board now see change --- healthy change --- as good for the Foundation. These changes, slow as they may have been to begin with, began long before I ever joined as ED. They continue today. Despite the strange lack of communication throughout and after August, I still firmly believe that the GNOME Foundation is the strongest it has ever been. If you have been wondering if you should stand for elections in 2026, do it. If you aren't sure if your vote matters in the elections, let me reassure you that it matters now more than ever.

If you feel, as members do, that the Foundation and the Project have been at odds in recent years, there is a new opportunity to help the Foundation correct its course, stabilize, and grow GNOME.

## Heavy Communication With Members

Because the executive is beholden to the board and the board is beholden to the membership, it is (I would hope) obvious that the executive and board should both communicate frequently and transparently with members.

I love reading [Allan's Foundation Updates](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/), a continuation of a practice we started while I was ED. Just before I left, I'd started hosting office hours. I'd also wanted to have quarterly panels. It's not possible for the ED or the President to have one-on-ones with every single Foundation member, all the time. But there should be opportunities outside of Matrix to engage in open and honest conversation.

## Financial Policy

I was very happy to see that [the board continued with the financial policy I introduced](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/foundation-budget-report-2025-26/32629):

* YoY balanced budget (balance recurring revenue with recurring expenses)
* Maintain the full board reserve, according to policy, without exception

I received significant pushback from one director on both of these, so it's reassuring to see the Foundation didn't backtrack. I don't consider either of these policies optional in a healthy corporation.

An ex-colleague from one of my alumni networks recently asked me "what did you learn from the experience of running the GNOME Foundation?" and my response was that I left believing even more firmly what I believed when I went in:

Run a nonprofit like any other business.

## Fiscal Controls

While I was at the Foundation, we began the process of implementing and documenting internal controls. We had some fantastic advice from our bookkeeper and accounting advisor. I'm told these improvements are continuing and that the Foundation is incrementally tightening its financial policy.

While I was at the Foundation, we had to implement some hard limits, such as pausing the staff travel policy. With well-documented and well-enforced internal controls, austerity measures like that should never have to happen again.

A close friend of mine asked me about the kinds of budgets nonprofits like the GNOME Foundation and Python Software Foundation are operating under. My response was that, for any foundation incorporated in the United States at least, you could just google "Blah Foundation 990" and get a pretty clear high-level picture of any nonprofit's finances. He was shocked to see that an organization like the PSF operates with [only about $4m in revenue](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/43594598). People often think of f/oss nonprofits as huge entities, like big-name tech companies, because their trademarks are so recognizable. But they aren't. Every dollar counts and every donation matters. Thus, tight fiscal controls are essential to keep costs under control.

## Fundraising

Within my first few weeks at the Foundation, I "pitched" a new fundraising strategy with the twofold goal of:

* move toward recurring revenue and move away from irregular, one-off cheques
* turn the GNOME Foundation into a grantmaker --- fund GNOME development directly

[Here is the slide deck, with 4 pages redacted](./pdf/2025-06-03-special-meeting_compressed.pdf). The Executive Director doesn't need the buy-in of the board to change course on fundraising. But this was only my third week on the job and I didn't want to commit to this massive shift in the fundraising strategy without board approval. The fundraising strategy outlined in the "pitch deck" is still in place. It's working well, and covering the Foundation's current ongoing expenses, but it will take a couple years to see it really bear fruit.

The first step was to build [donate.gnome.org](https://donate.gnome.org) --- the Foundation (and I) owe everything in that project to Sam Hewitt, Jakub Steiner, and Bart Piotrowski. As the landing page for donations to the Foundation, `d.g.o` is paramount in turning the Foundation around.

The second step is to make the Foundation a grantmaker, one way or another. Either to use unrestricted funds to solve an acute problem over a narrow timeframe (say, 3 months) or to provide a fellowship, similar to what the Rust Foundation used to do with their Grants Program. Or something else entirely. As long as the GNOME Foundation starts paying hackers directly with unrestricted donations, it's a grantmaker. It doesn't really matter how.

Where does the money go, though? Are donors paying for GNOME Calendar, Flatpak 2.0, or bugfixes in GNOME Online Accounts? This is tricky. The Foundation can't dictate the technical direction of the project, and that includes technical priority. But it shouldn't completely ignore the desires of donors, either. Striking a balance between [the steering group](https://www.youtube.com/live/18Ir6RXkIeA?si=uwOFJUYtRga7hYTZ&t=3381) and feedback from donors would be a process of experimentation and discovery. Luckily, most corporate donors are primarily interested in _infrastructure._ They'd rather fix libraries and services than apps or GNOME Shell. So perhaps it would be natural for the Foundation's grantmaking to focus on user-visible changes which, in turn, would lead to more donations, since donors could see the positive change their donations make.

On the topic of grantmaking, I hear the board has a plan in the works to finance some GNOME development. I look forward to seeing what they come up with.

The third step is to talk about donations to GNOME. Loudly. Podcasts, YouTube, and traditional media. (Aside: Tweet-shaped social media, not so much. The rallying cry for user participation will be met with crickets on LinkedIn.) My original intention was to do this myself. Perhaps the best option with a Community Executive is to assign someone (whether they're a director of the board or not) to act as a spokesperson. Such a person would probably become synonymous with GNOME, as Miguel was once upon a time. An alternative would be to distribute this responsibility but that risks diluting the message and reducing (or never building up) the recognizability of public personas.

Public personas need to know the audience. The PR exercise of marketing GNOME's donation page will require finesse. The GNOME Foundation has a habit of preaching to the choir. It's hardly the only first-wave open source project that is stuck in this rut but messaging to donors within the community, versus GNOME's millions of users, versus corporate donors, versus government donors? Every one should highlight very different aspects. Governments care about Digital Sovereignty. Users care about features and stability. Thoughtful users will care about GNOME's infrastructure, like GitLab. GNOME hackers care about GUADEC. There isn't a lot of overlap. Red Hat employees will donate every year because they love GNOME. You don't need to win them over. Focus on the donations you _don't have._

The last step is to get Canonical to stop patching out the "Please Donate" notification in Ubuntu. I can appreciate why Canonical currently does this. Since the Foundation doesn't finance GNOME development yet, there's an argument to be made that Canonical isn't obligated to participate beyond their [Advisory Board membership](https://foundation.gnome.org/advisory-board). You may or may not agree with that but the way to convince Canonical that Ubuntu should support the GNOME Foundation with a "Donate" button is to demonstrate that Ubuntu users who make such donations see returns in their operating system of choice: Ubuntu. Ubuntu is built on GNOME (you might even say it's _mostly_ GNOME) so if the donations fund GNOME development directly, then everything checks out.



## Organizational Excellence

Participation in the GNOME project has always been marked by technical excellence. It isn't a secret within the GNOME community that the Foundation [hasn't always met this bar](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2025/04/11/gnome-stf-2024/#planning-coordination-reporting).

Basic operating procedures, documentation, document archival policies, and financial stability are not the mark of business excellence. Everything described above is pretty basic stuff. Excellence at the Foundation will only come from reshaping the organization from the ground up.

## Feedback

It is the mark of a healthy organization that its members can engage in open and honest feedback.

I received many complaints about the Foundation even in the 3 or 4 months I spent as ED but these didn't come with any structure. Rather, they took the form of DMs or emails from members, sent directly to me, with a sampling bias for those individuals willing to email a new ED out of the blue. The medium makes sense, when you think about it. The alternative at the time was to raise feedback in public Matrix channels, where bad faith actors lurk, or to broadcast something on Planet GNOME. There was no middle ground.

Before I left the ED post, I created a private Matrix channel for GNOME Foundation members. I also proposed creating a similar, members-only space on Discourse (this space doesn't exist yet; I'm not sure if that's seen any progress behind the scenes). Foundation members are the top of the accountability and control hierarchy --- they should have a way to speak directly to the board of directors and ED that sits between the high-friction world of emails and the high-visibility world of blogs posts.

Perhaps more important than open communication between the membership and the board, however, is open communication between individuals. I can't count the number of times people raised complaints directly to me, about someone else.

Raising a complaint about someone without first speaking to that person is a bizarre and unhealthy pattern of behaviour. Try not to do that. Before running to the ED, the board, or the CoCC, talk to the person you're having difficulty with. They may be receptive. They may not. But it's worth your effort, every time.

It is the Foundation's responsibility to help guide the community. Learning to provide feedback to someone is a skill like any other. GNOME hackers are community members like any other. This isn't an unsolvable puzzle. There are coaches, nonprofit advisory consultants, and other third parties who can help the Foundation with this process. The Foundation can't bootstrap itself out of bad habits, much less teach the community a skill most of the directors lack themselves. Thankfully, there is help out there --- and much of it is free. Also thankfully, some of the newer directors are excellent communicators and can measure whether or not a particular coach or consultant is helping the Foundation.

## Accountability

The Foundation struggles to hold its staff, directors, and officers accountable for patterns of broken behaviour. I am not referring to one-off mistakes: a forgotten task, a momentary lack of judgment, or a dropped ball. _Patterns of behaviour_ are marked by repeatedly failing to deliver: repeatedly failing to own a task, project, or strategy from start to finish.

Just as there are two scales to the Foundation (the board and the staff), there are two scales to accountability. Staff need to be held accountable for work at the task or project level. "I told you about this a month ago." is the canonical antipattern. Did this person follow up? Was there a clear delineation of responsibility? Was everyone clear on what needed to be accomplished, and by when? There are Staff, Infrastructure, and Board project walls in GitLab for this purpose. The board need to be held accountable for work at the strategic level: what are the goals of the organization for this year? Five years? Ten years? Is the ED ensuring that we meet those goals? Last, the ED needs to be held accountable for both. The ED helps the board decide on strategy and enables the staff to execute on it. In an organization as small as the GNOME Foundation, the ED will be executing on a lot of tasks herself, directly.

The GNOME Foundation board, at the top of this hierarchy, is a "working board" (in the sense that they are heavily involved in the day-to-day operation of the business) and a 9-person board can make accountability too diffuse. As a result, it's useful for the membership to narrow in on board leadership when evaluating the board's performance. The timescales are long but, helpfully, board elections only happen once a year. This May, I strongly encourage the Foundation membership to retrospect on the past five years. There were some significant leadership changes in August of 2025 and if you have concerns about the Foundation's legacy strategies, provide that feedback to the new board so they can learn from past mistakes.

## Transparency

"Transparency" is a term that somehow manages to confuse a lot of people. As a consequence, people debate the merits of transparency, with each side of the argument grounded in this confusion.

Back in 2016, I gave a CreativeMornings talk about [our transparency strategy at Nilenso](https://youtu.be/0sUMbqdHhME). (Apologies for two things: First, yes, I'm presenting on a Mac. 2016 Nilenso had a lot of Macs in the office and that happened to be the computer available. Second, I'm sorry the acoustics of that building were horrible.) You can go and watch the talk but tl;dw:

* transparency lives _on a spectrum_ --- it's not binary
* the word "transparency" in the context of organizations refers to _reducing the chance of corruption_
* transparency reduces corruption by merit of being "read-write", not "read-only" --- observing the thing changes the thing

The Foundation will benefit from transparency. _A lot more_ transparency. Private, members-only conversation channels help with this. [Allan's Foundation Updates](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/) help with this. Fresh blood in leadership positions at the Foundation will help with this. But every one of these is really just the beginning. The Foundation will achieve excellence, in my opinion, when it finds an optimal balance in the act of sharing the vast majority of its strategy, execution, and operation with the membership --- in a way that is easy to digest and receptive to feedback.

The word "balance" here is key. It does not make the GNOME Foundation "transparent" if everyone can read every line item in the organization's accounting history, see what every contractor is being paid, or record every board meeting on video and publish it to YouTube. That's a firehose of information no one can keep up with, which would only act as a magnet for trolls.

Other organizations indulge the firehose, and that's fine. Buffer [publishes its employees salaries](https://buffer.com/open). The postmarketOS team [publish a financial transparency report that links to spreadsheets](https://postmarketos.org/blog/2025/12/19/contributor-compensantion-and-financial-update/). These are extreme examples and the GNOME Foundation can't go this far, in part because it needs to consider the safety of staff and the sanity of its directors.

It's also important to consider that different layers of the organization require transparency at different scales. The membership, the board, the executive, the staff, the wider hacker community, and the general public all produce and consume information and different rates and at different volumes. With a Community Executive, the Foundation enjoys fewer layers to contend with and transparency as a function of public relations is simplified, somewhat.

The outcome of increased transparency can be immense. Transparency --- especially transparency at the right scale, granularity, and volume, targetting the right audience --- will rebuild the community's trust in the Foundation. Members will then be more likely to participate, which in turn will lead to more vibrant elections, which in turn will lead to higher transparency by community osmosis. It's a virtuous circle.

## Board of Directors

A clear indication that the Foundation is healing will be when too many people run for board elections. It should be an honour to sit on the board of directors. And it will be, eventually.

This is one aspect of the Foundation I had backwards, initially. When I joined in May, I tried as hard as I could to recruit candidates with accounting, legal, governance, and management backgrounds. "Just because someone has mastered Rust doesn't make them a great director," I thought. And while that's true, just because someone has a management background doesn't make them a great director, either.

The strongest directors have been those with an unwavering commitment to GNOME. They aren't on the board to boost their own organization's standing and they aren't there to twist the knife on petty grievances. Good directors sit on the board because they want to see GNOME stronger in 2056 than it is in 2026. Good directors put in the work. Good directors have the difficult conversations.

Hackers can absolutely make great directors.

## Policy Governance

I spoke about [Policy Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Governance) in [my GUADEC 2025 keynote](https://youtu.be/26ys1p6VVs0?t=1286). I worked almost exclusively with Allan Day for my 3 or 4 months at the Foundation. I really enjoyed working with Allan and I believe that, generally, we agreed on how the Foundation should operate.

This is the one place where Allan and I differed in opinion. He's been around both GNOME and the Foundation for much longer. He has expressed the opinion that the board's heavy involvement in the Foundation's operation is a good thing. I tend to disagree. I believe a high level of involvement from the Executive Committee in a 501(c)(3) is an antipattern, indicative of cash flow issues, a failure of management, or a failure of operations --- or all three.

That said, the current situation is perhaps the best possible outcome. If the board and the Executive Committee are going to be deeply involved in the operation of the Foundation anyway, lean in. A Community Executive has distinct advantages: it saves money, it unifies the management strategy, and it brings the board (and thus, the membership) closer to the day-to-day operations of the Foundation which, in turn, should assure the Foundation satisfies its mission and the desires of the membership. A Community Executive also benefits from decades of GNOME experience.

Perhaps, years in the future, the board will choose to hire another staff executive. If and when they do, I still believe that Policy Governance will be their friend and I will continue to advocate for it along those timelines.

## Shift to Infrastructure

With a vanishingly small staff, the GNOME Foundation needs anchors to maintain ownership of its most important tooling. Directors will come and go. Someone needs to hold down the fort over a longer window of time.

The peculiar advantage of a software-focused nonprofit is the same operational advantage of software companies: automation and infrastructure. [New finance platforms](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2026/01/16/gnome-foundation-update-2026-01-16/) are being put in place at the Foundation, which is excellent. While I was there, we moved all banking ownership from the accounting function of the organization to the treasury function (the President and Treasurer). This is the correct alignment of tooling and access for the Foundation's finances, and both of these adjustments represent a wonderful step forward.

Beyond this, however, I firmly believe all non-banking tools should move under the umbrella of the GNOME Foundation's [Infrastructure Team](https://handbook.gnome.org/infrastructure.html). This includes payment processors, ForEx tooling, contract software, and so on. The selfless efforts of Andrea and Bart over the years have demonstrated them to be some of the most loyal and trustworthy actors across the GNOME Foundation. In a nonprofit apocalypse, when everything else falls apart, they are the ones who will keep the lights on, whether they're paid for it or not.

## Diversity



* corporate diversity (spread out Red Hat risk)
* more diversity in hackers, not the board
  * the board is made of members; don't force board diversity if it's not there in the membership; solve the root problem
* broaden the base: bring in more app developers
* focus less on outreach programs like Outreachy and GSoC (which would help unburden Felipe, also) and focus more on mid- to senior-level developers.

## The Future

* detach from legacy f/oss nonprofit social networks
  * EDs / CEOs describe as "incestuous"
* move the Foundation to Europe
* keep "GNOME", get rid of the foot
  * rebecca's reaction
