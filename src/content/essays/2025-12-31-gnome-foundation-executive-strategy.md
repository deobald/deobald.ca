preface: As a requirement of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign the gag letter Robert McQueen sent me. However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation's directors, past and present. Some of the following may read as criticism.

I still have no idea what happened in August. I'm beginning to believe I never will. The board's decision from August 12th was never discussed with me and I was never provided any reason for it. From my side of the table, that total lack of communication was a serious problem, unto itself. But I could see the writing on the wall during GUADEC, which is why my keynote was 90% easter eggs. Even so, it has a lot of my strategic thinking baked into it and I'd encourage you to revisit that talk if you're interested in the strategy I laid out for the Foundation while I was briefly ED.

* focus on the mission
  * it is illegal not to follow the 501c3 mission
  * certain directors quietly push for politics in the foundation
  * contrast: PSF makes clear decisions wrt their presence in the US, when they pertain directly to the PSF mission

* focus on the institution
  * link podcast
  * succession planning
  * financial stability
  * organizational excellence
  * diversity


## succession planning

* "death" - david, aaron, 501c3 good governance
* nurture the next generation: Design Team as good example


## financial stability

* fiscal policy
  * reduce costs
  * focus on MRR/ARR
  * aside: Ankur's shock at Foundation budgets
  * balance the budget, YoY
  * board reserve

* fundraising
  * slide deck (costs can be derived from 990s)
  * d.g.o
  * fund development
  * talk about gnome on podcasts, youtube
  * stop Canonical from patching out Donate notification in Ubuntu


## Organizational Excellence

* board
  * I had it backwards: hackers make good directors
  * where are our Canonical friends? -- they're on the Ad Board; get them memberships and get them on the board, too

* policy governance
  * this would still be my preference but, after August, I'm not convinced it's a good idea for the Foundation to have a staff ED ... no one wants to work for 9 bosses who ghost you for weeks at a time.
  * perhaps the current situation is the best possible outcome: have the board accept that they're deeply involved in the foundation's executive activities anyway, and maintain a community executive, rather than staff.

* shift to infrastructure
  * operational struggles
  * infra doesn't have this problem: bart and andrea are excellent and very trustworthy
  * banking has been moved into the treasury function (pres, treasurer), non-banking tools should move into infra: Stripe, Wise.com, etc.
  * automate

* accountability, feedback, open honest comm
  * private chan in matrix
  * private area in discourse?


## Diversity

* corporate diversity (spread out Red Hat risk)
* more diversity in hackers, not the board
  * the board is made of members; don't force board diversity if it's not there in the membership; solve the root problem
* broaden the base: bring in more app developers
* focus less on outreach programs like Outreachy and GSoC (which would help unburden Felipe, also) and focus more on mid- to senior-level developers.
