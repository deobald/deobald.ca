After 13 years of entrepreneurship,
running businesses like
[Nilenso](https://nilenso.com/)
(India's first worker-owned tech company)
and
[Endatabas](https://www.endatabas.com/)
(earth's first immutable SQL database),
I'm looking for full-time employment.
I've enjoyed starting unique companies from scratch and taking them as far as I can, but now I want to help grow something larger than I could build myself.

If you don't know me: I'm Steven, an
engineering manager
and developer from Canada.
I have 15+ years of experience building and growing technology teams, while ensuring they build the right product.
Over those years, I've spent more time in management roles, but lately I've also been writing code again.
I build, evolve, and maintain backend Ruby on Rails codebases for non-profits.
I've been writing code for 30 years, but I will always
[sweep the floor](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/apprenticeship-patterns/9780596806842/ch04.html#sweep_the_floor).

I can help you:

* Build, grow, and manage software teams
* Write the backend code that powers your business

I write a lot.
I write whitepapers, essays, and documentation for work.
I write fiction for fun.
I've given a couple keynotes in my life.
I'm [easy to google](https://www.google.com/?q=steven%20deobald).

Although I currently live in Halifax, I lived in India for 10 years and I will happily travel there for work.
I understand the work culture in India --- and I love helping teams across continents collaborate productively.
I've also lived and worked in The Bay, Vancouver, Calgary, Chicago, New York, London, and Hyrule.
I'm comfortable with travel, but Halifax also has 5+ working hours overlap with ([almost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ApIp1P5Uk)) any timezone in Europe or America.
