It's been half a decade since I updated my personal reading list.
Seems like as good a time as any to create another little time capsule.

## I want to read

I'm trying to keep this list shorter.
Hopefully I'll revisit this document with a new version in 2026.

* _House of Leaves_, Danielewski
* _The Buddha before Buddhism_, Fronsdal
* _The Body Keeps the Score_, van der Kolk
* _Gideon the Ninth_, Muir
* _How to Invent Everything_, North

Also, [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67034748).
It's kind of a mess, though.

## I am reading

* _Nexus_, Harari

## I have read

In no particular order.
I'm missing a bunch, but these are recent books that were either good enough, bad enough, or frustrating enough to remember.

* _The Founder's Dilemmas_, Wasserman: 1 star. This could have been an A4.
* _A Timeless Way of Building_, _A Pattern Language_, _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, Alexander: Stop applying these to software and just read them in their own right. They are so good. (Re-read.)
* _Exhalation_, Chiang: Excellent.
* _Reinventing Organizations_, Laloux: If he ever does a new edition where he drops _Sounds True, Inc._ from the list of case studies, this book is probably worthy of 5 stars. I love the thesis, and as someone who also loves Capital-C Co-operatives, I also love that he challenges my prior beliefs, since there isn't a single co-op in the book.
* _Poor Economics_, Banerjee: Lord love a duck, what a frustrating book. There are lots of interesting nuggets in here. (Did you know a human being can get all required nutrients from just eggs and bananas?) But there's also a lot of flawed logic.
* _Journey of Insight Meditation: A Personal Experience of the Buddha's Way_, Lerner: This is a pretty darn good first-hand account of someone's earnest attempt to learn meditation. Probably the only book of its kind but it won't be for everyone.
* _The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay_, Chabon: EXCELLENT. I find I rarely enjoy fiction these days, but this was a delight in every _single_ sentence.
* _Prophet Song_, Lynch: 2 stars, do not recommend
* _Lessons in Chemistry_, Garmus: 1 star. Rape your main character on page 15, get zero respect from me. Designed to be a TV show. Surprise! It's on Apple TV.
* _Butter Honey Pig Bread_, Ekwuyasi: Entire chunks of the storyline didn't line up. The writing is amateur. I didn't enjoy this.
* _Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow_, Zevin: 4 stars, pokes my every nostalgia button. Also excellent writing. A great read after _Hackers_.
* _Hackers_, Levy: Every developer should read this.
* _The Employees_, Ravn: ??? stars, I didn't know this was an abstract art piece when I read it. Wups.
* _S. N. Goenka: Emissary of Insight_, Stuart: 1 star, the author knows some things. The author is a collosal pain in the ass who assumes he knows much more than he actually knows, both about Goenka and about Indian culture in general. White people who haven't lived in India probably just shouldn't write these kinds of books? I dunno. Or just keep your thinly-veiled criticism on your blog.
* _The Birth of Insight_, Braun: Ledi Sayadaw was a remarkable and influential figure, no doubt, but Braun can be a little fawning at times. Still, he at least cites all his sources, unlike Stuart (above) whose citations mostly amount to "a guy at my yoga studio said he heard that...."
* _Greenwood_, Christie: 3 or 4 stars... a fun multi-generational bite-sized epic. Do not believe the reviews that say this book is about climate change; it's not.
* _Freedom from the Known_, Krishnamurti: 4 stars, always a blessing.
* _The Three-Body Problem_, Liu/Cixin: 5 stars.
* _The Paper Menagerie_, Liu: 1 star. I do not enjoy Liu's writing, just his translation.
* _Clear and Simple As the Truth_, Turner/Thomas: 4 stars, this is some arrogant hand-waving but these fellows are incredibly talented hand-wavers. Gets very repetitive about 60% of the way through.
* _Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software_, Eghbal: 0 stars. I fear if Eghbal ever reads my review, it will make her sad. I don't want to do that. But no book has ever made me quite so angry as this one. It is very poorly researched and very badly written.
* _On Writing Well_, Zinsser: Meh.
* _Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book_, Ingram: 0 stars, I was forced to re-read this for research purposes.
* _Conversations Regarding the Fatalistic Outlook of the Common Man_, Manickavel: 4 stars, you should read Kuzhali if you can find her books.
* _Ada, or Ardor_, Nabokov: 4 stars, extremely pretentious but maybe Nabokov's writing deserves it. Revisited, not re-read.
