        From the original local-first essay (or its pdf version) to Martin Kleppmann&rsquo;s much-simplified inversion of Leslie Lamport&rsquo;s definition of a distributed system:
In local-first software, the availability of another computer should never prevent you from working.
&hellip;it&rsquo;s been difficult to get a handle on a good definition for &ldquo;local-first&rdquo;. Personally, I&rsquo;ve decided the reason for this is because &ldquo;local-first&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a binary label we can cleanly apply to something. It&rsquo;s more of a spectrum.

        After 13 years of entrepreneurship, running businesses like Nilenso (India&rsquo;s first worker-owned tech company) and Endatabas (earth&rsquo;s first immutable SQL database), I&rsquo;m looking for full-time employment. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed starting unique companies from scratch and taking them as far as I can, but now I want to help grow something larger than I could build myself.
If you don&rsquo;t know me: I&rsquo;m Steven, an engineering manager and developer from Canada. I have 15+ years of experience building and growing technology teams, while ensuring they build the right product.

        I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I&rsquo;m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn&rsquo;t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav&rsquo;s recommendation &mdash; and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.
I have been alive for approximately four decades. Each of those decades was witness to its own fun brand of computering.

        Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) is an only-loosely-agreed-upon term for businesses built upon selling open source products. COSS has seen two significant waves pass, with a third now emerging. The head of each wave lasts approximately a decade. The tail of each wave extends into the future indefinitely. Each wave subsumes all previous waves.
The first wave was characterized by shrinkwrapping and commercial support. Peaking in the mid-1990s, Red Hat was the poster-child of selling support for software written by other people.

        I am carrying a bucket of human waste. Two buckets, actually. I’m visiting an off-grid cabin in an Acadian forest where the vegetable garden is nourished by a humanure composting system. It’s my turn to take out the, uh, compost. Every visit to this forest is an opportunity to get away from Twitter, away from the noise of the city, and enjoy a simpler life as a temporary monastic hobo.

        Driving down the #9 highway in Southeast Saskatchewan yesterday, I giggled in surprise when I noticed a small piece of Internet lodged in a canola field. I saw the unmistakeable orange logo as we approached the unincorporated hamlet of Görlitz (population unknown) from the north. Amid the other billboards for bulk fertilizer and local honey was a painted plywood sign: Bitcoin ATM now available!
Just what Görlitz needs. I’m not sure if humanity has reached peak cryptocurrency yet but we are definitely on our way.

        The computer is a curious gadget. It is one of few human inventions which can exist purely – yet accurately – in the imagination. Prior to the existence of a real computing machine, mathematicians could hypothesize how it might behave. They even understood the unbounded, fractal potential of computers: If human beings have machines for computation we also have the atom of computation and we can recombine these atoms to great effect.

        Can I interest you in a nutrition label?
Ethics! We all have a few. Every day, my personal ethics evolve in varying degrees. It seemed harmless to speak loudly and abrasively in my early twenties &mdash; a speech full of arbitrary and contrary words. Who was I hurting? Now I know. The increments of personal ethics evolution are slow and sometimes the work takes decades. Crossing the bridge of intoxicants, for example.

&ldquo;Land in Canada costs how much?&rdquo; Ragul queries me a second time. His eyes are wide and I can tell he&rsquo;s asking me to confirm the cost of property in Eastern Canada because half of him doesn&rsquo;t believe it.
&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;$23,000 CAD for 20–30 acres is&hellip;&rdquo; I pull out my phone and start punching the forex conversion into the search box but he gives me the answer off the top of his head before I can finish.

        The 2019 Canadian federal election is over. I doubt anyone feels very good about it. Not because a minority government threatens to immobilize the Canadian government. I mean, there is that. But the suffocating air of this election was far less tangible, far less quantifiable, than counted ballots. The outmoded left-right political spectrum is gasping for breath through a death rattle and, for those of us who plan to be here on the far side, it&rsquo;s disgusting to watch.
