      <description>PMS. I still can&amp;rsquo;t remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: &amp;ldquo;My Mom was really grouchy this morning.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Oh, she probably has PMS.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Is that a disease?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Nah, it&amp;rsquo;s something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone.&amp;rdquo;</description>

Over the last few days, the internet saw a layered explosion of conversation regarding Adria Richards, and a conversation which happened near her at PyCon 2013. To me, it looked like this:
The first circle represents the initial event. The second circle represents Adria&amp;rsquo;s public reaction. The third circle represents the reactions of HackerNews, Twitter, Playhaven, SendGrid, Anonymous, 4chan, and the internet at large to Adria&amp;rsquo;s reaction.</description>
