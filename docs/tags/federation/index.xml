      <description>I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I&amp;rsquo;m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav&amp;rsquo;s recommendation &amp;mdash; and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.&#xA;I have been alive for approximately four decades.

The increments of personal ethics evolution are slow and sometimes the work takes decades. Crossing the bridge of intoxicants, for example.</description>

      <description>In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harari repeatedly emphasizes the need for society to apply critical thinking to the future of software, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Harari is one of the more forward-thinking philosophers when it comes to disruptive technology and 21 Lessons lucidly collects the requirements for our species&amp;rsquo; future: our new tools must sustainably respect future arcs of aggregate data use and they must do so globally.</description>
