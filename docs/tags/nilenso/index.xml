      <description>If you are not already familiar with nilenso, I apologize. This article may not make any sense to you. Requested as an opinion piece in reply to an internal email on salaries, it hinges on a lot of context.&#xA;You may find that context interesting.&#xA;YourStory: India&amp;rsquo;s first software co-operative Huh? A Software Cooperative? &amp;mdash; an introduction How to Co-op: Salaries and Reviews &amp;ldquo;I have cramps.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; introducing our menstrual leave policy nilenso policies &amp;mdash; democratic corporate benefits nilenso reviews &amp;mdash; how do we evaluate one another?</description>

      <description>PMS. I still can&amp;rsquo;t remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: &amp;ldquo;My Mom was really grouchy this morning.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Oh, she probably has PMS.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Is that a disease?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Nah, it&amp;rsquo;s something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about how thankful I am, after a decade in software, to work for an employer which inherently understands my values and the values of all my colleagues. That employer is me. That employer is also all of my colleagues. That employer is nilenso: a software cooperative owned and operated by its employees here in Bangalore.&#xA;What is a coop? According to Wikipedia: &amp;ldquo;A cooperative (&amp;ldquo;coop&amp;rdquo;) or co-operative (&amp;ldquo;co-op&amp;rdquo;) is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit.</description>
