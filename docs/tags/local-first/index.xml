      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the local-first scene over the past few years, you already know a good definition for the term &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo; is hard to pin down.&#xA;Part of the reason is that most people write software for money &amp;hellip; and true local-first software is harder to capitalize. &amp;ldquo;Local-first&amp;rdquo; is a direct attack on vendor lock-in of all forms: data, formats, protocols, apps, services, and even environments. But the fact your employer can&amp;rsquo;t exploit this technology with a new revenue model (yet) is a minor problem.</description>

      <description>I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I&amp;rsquo;m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav&amp;rsquo;s recommendation &amp;mdash; and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.&#xA;I have been alive for approximately four decades. Each of those decades was witness to its own fun brand of computering.</description>
