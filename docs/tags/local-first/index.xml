      <description>From the original local-first essay (or its pdf version) to Martin Kleppmann&amp;rsquo;s much-simplified inversion of Leslie Lamport&amp;rsquo;s definition of a distributed system:&#xA;In local-first software, the availability of another computer should never prevent you from working.&#xA;&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to get a handle on a good definition for &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo;. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided the reason for this is because &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a binary label we can cleanly apply to something. It&amp;rsquo;s more of a spectrum.</description>

      <description>I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I&amp;rsquo;m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav&amp;rsquo;s recommendation &amp;mdash; and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.&#xA;I have been alive for approximately four decades. Each of those decades was witness to its own fun brand of computering.</description>
