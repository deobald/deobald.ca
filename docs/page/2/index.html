        Disclaimer and Full Disclosure: I began writing this article in July, during my last week at nilenso. Go-Jek is a client of nilenso's. My views represent neither company.
 I just re-read Steve Yegge's &ldquo;Why I left Google to join Grab&rdquo; article. My heart is pumping. I'm excited. Just not in the way he intended.
You may have forgotten about Yegge's article between the beginning and end of 2018 so feel free to go back and refresh your memory.

        &ldquo;I only have two goals for my kids,&rdquo; Paige announced calmly as she set her chai down. &ldquo;One, I don’t want them to be assholes; they shouldn’t mistreat anybody; they should be nice people. And two, I don’t want them to become substance abusers.&rdquo;
It is natural for people our age to worry about drug addiction in the upcoming generation. During the 80s, our impressionable childhood years we were filled with a multitude of tax-funded warnings.

        We started siggu.org with the very rough intention of answering one question: Why meditate? We have multiple axes across which we will write in an attempt to answer this question: neuroscience, infrastructure, policy, and health &mdash; among others.
Siggu itself is a Pali word. It means horseradish. There is nothing particularly special about a horseradish. It is a strong taste, one that most people grow into with time. The taste changes with the age of the horseradish and planting it demands multiple growing seasons before the first harvest.

        If you are not already familiar with nilenso, I apologize. This article may not make any sense to you. Requested as an opinion piece in reply to an internal email on salaries, it hinges on a lot of context.
You may find that context interesting.

        PMS. I still can't remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don't remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: &ldquo;My Mom was really grouchy this morning.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Oh, she probably has PMS.&rdquo; - &ldquo;Is that a disease?&rdquo; - &ldquo;Nah, it's something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone.&rdquo;

        Riding a bicycle in Bangalore is surprisingly easy. Bicycles are nimble and the traffic is slow. The roads are&hellip; good enough. The weather is perfect. The pollution is an issue but not riding a bicycle only exacerbates that situation. Here are my recommendations for making riding a bike in Bangalore something between tolerable and enjoyable.
Required: Good Brakes Traffic in Bangalore isn't just slow &mdash; it's choppy. Millions of people driving cars on roads that can't support them mean traffic is as stop-and-go as a choked suburban freeway parking lot in America.

        This past week, nilenso interviewed a German fellow for a software development position. As part of the routine of meeting a new stranger in this city, a variation of &ldquo;Why do you live in Bangalore?&rdquo; passed between us. My answer to this question is complex and usually varies based on the tone and implied subtext with which the question is asked. My immediate reasons are somewhat boring. My job is here and I like my job.

        Tom Hall asked me once how nilenso decided salaries when we have no bonuses. This is a question we get often.
Our first stab at this was a model we'd inherited from other companies we'd worked at: have salary bands which match up to the skill and experience of the current staff, match that to the available cash, and set salaries accordingly. At first, we actually started off with an approach that was even more naive &ndash; rather than salary bands, we had &ldquo;levels&rdquo;.

        This is a brief idea I remembered while cleaning up some old files. It initially occurred to me while discussing the status of my eyes with the surgeon after I had a vitrectomy and scleral buckle. Our conversations were terrible. He would stare at the back of my eye with his lenses and probes, ask what I saw, I would give a lengthy description (forgetting a few things) and he would inevitably only write down one or two things I said.

        I've recently returned to Canada for a month to visit family. While here, I've run into some old friends (and friends of friends) whom I haven't been in contact with since moving to Bangalore three years ago. &ldquo;Oh! You live in India? What's that like?&rdquo; is one common conversation piece. Or the frequent line of questioning which positions the entire subcontinent as though it were a chic new restaurant: &ldquo;India? You must like it.
