      <description>PMS. I still can&#39;t remember first learning about Pre-Menstrual Symptoms as a child. I don&#39;t remember the specific event, but the understanding conveyed. I imagine it went something like this: &amp;ldquo;My Mom was really grouchy this morning.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Oh, she probably has PMS.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Is that a disease?&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;Nah, it&#39;s something that happens to Moms once a month. They get really grouchy and you should just leave them alone.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>How To Bicycle Commute in Bangalore</title>

      <description>Riding a bicycle in Bangalore is surprisingly easy. Bicycles are nimble and the traffic is slow. The roads are&amp;hellip; good enough. The weather is perfect. The pollution is an issue but not riding a bicycle only exacerbates that situation. Here are my recommendations for making riding a bike in Bangalore something between tolerable and enjoyable.
Required: Good Brakes Traffic in Bangalore isn&#39;t just slow &amp;mdash; it&#39;s choppy. Millions of people driving cars on roads that can&#39;t support them mean traffic is as stop-and-go as a choked suburban freeway parking lot in America.</description>

      <description>This past week, nilenso interviewed a German fellow for a software development position. As part of the routine of meeting a new stranger in this city, a variation of &amp;ldquo;Why do you live in Bangalore?&amp;rdquo; passed between us. My answer to this question is complex and usually varies based on the tone and implied subtext with which the question is asked. My immediate reasons are somewhat boring. My job is here and I like my job.</description>

      <title>Salaries in a Cooperative</title>

      <description>Tom Hall asked me once how nilenso decided salaries when we have no bonuses. This is a question we get often.
Our first stab at this was a model we&#39;d inherited from other companies we&#39;d worked at: have salary bands which match up to the skill and experience of the current staff, match that to the available cash, and set salaries accordingly. At first, we actually started off with an approach that was even more naive &amp;ndash; rather than salary bands, we had &amp;ldquo;levels&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This is a brief idea I remembered while cleaning up some old files. It initially occurred to me while discussing the status of my eyes with the surgeon after I had a vitrectomy and scleral buckle. Our conversations were terrible. He would stare at the back of my eye with his lenses and probes, ask what I saw, I would give a lengthy description (forgetting a few things) and he would inevitably only write down one or two things I said.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve recently returned to Canada for a month to visit family. While here, I&#39;ve run into some old friends (and friends of friends) whom I haven&#39;t been in contact with since moving to Bangalore three years ago. &amp;ldquo;Oh! You live in India? What&#39;s that like?&amp;rdquo; is one common conversation piece. Or the frequent line of questioning which positions the entire subcontinent as though it were a chic new restaurant: &amp;ldquo;India? You must like it.</description>

      <description>He squinted through a pair of wrap-around sunglasses, the kind one often expects to see on the crowning end of a wheelchair with wings of lenses spread wide and soaring across a sea of wrinkles &amp;ndash; or drool, if the sea had previously suffered a stroke. Or at home in makeshift bingo halls constructed of a dusty old Lions Club because all the Lions and Lionesses were dead and even the Rotary Club (Rotors?</description>

      <title>Drugs, Meditation, Warnings</title>
      <link>https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2015-01-01-drugs-meditation-warnings/</link>

      <description>I recently returned to work from my second 10-day Vipassana course. After such a course, friends are always curious about the experience. Because Vipassana meditation courses are largely indescribable, the conversation often drifts to one&#39;s journey toward Vipassana, and the journey toward meditation in general. For me, this journey has been a mixture of friendships, literature, and drugs. Drugs can be seen as a stepping-stone to my current meditation practice because a few drugs have similar insightful (informational) qualities.</description>

      <title>What is a Software Cooperative?</title>
      <link>https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2014-11-02-what-is-a-software-cooperative/</link>

      <description>I recently wrote about how thankful I am, after a decade in software, to work for an employer which inherently understands my values and the values of all my colleagues. That employer is me. That employer is also all of my colleagues. That employer is nilenso: a software cooperative owned and operated by its employees here in Bangalore.
What is a coop? According to Wikipedia: &amp;ldquo;A cooperative (&amp;ldquo;coop&amp;rdquo;) or co-operative (&amp;ldquo;co-op&amp;rdquo;) is an autonomous association of persons who voluntarily cooperate for their mutual social, economic, and cultural benefit.</description>

      <description>I recently suffered the most severe injuries of my life &amp;mdash; I experienced a retinal tear and detachment which led to multiple surgeries. Those surgeries themselves have permanently damaged my vision and physically deformed my right eye. While I was recovering, I was unable to read, use a computer, or watch video. Oh. And I was in California, on business. The surgeries prevented me from flying so I was unable to go home to India or home-home to Canada.</description>

      <description>A description of a doctrine without words is not a doctrine without words.
Over the last few days, the internet saw a layered explosion of conversation regarding Adria Richards, and a conversation which happened near her at PyCon 2013. To me, it looked like this:
 The first circle represents the initial event. The second circle represents Adria&#39;s public reaction. The third circle represents the reactions of HackerNews, Twitter, Playhaven, SendGrid, Anonymous, 4chan, and the internet at large to Adria&#39;s reaction.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of working for a startup like C42 Engineering (where I help build rubymonk.com &amp;mdash; the name is a coincidence) is the broad range of experiences available, both in and out of the office. Thanks to our flexible work environment, I was able to travel to Himachal Pradesh for a couple weeks of experimenting on myself as a break from experimenting with software. I know not everyone enjoys such benefits, so let me start by saying this: I am thankful.</description>

      <description>The curiosity of my coworkers at ThoughtWorks often leads to a number of healthy and interesting debates, which often occur in the pub, on internal mailing lists, and anywhere in-between. One such discussion, of the mailing list variety, revolved around the topic Chinese economics and politics. Inevitably, the recent Angry Red Dragon issue of The Economist was mentioned in passing as participants shuffled over the topic of general Western opinions on China.</description>

      <description>The other day I was listening to assorted tracks in my reading room while enjoying a glass of scotch and puttering away in the codebase of my current project. I was feeling chipper, the sun was shining. On Saturdays I&#39;m willing to play the music loud enough to feel engrossed and I was looking for a bit of a beat in most of what I was listening to.
I own an iPod Video, and if we discount the fact that Winamp seems to be the only reliable way of getting data on and off the device, it does a satisfactory job of playing music.</description>

      <description>The Theory Moving to a new country often involves adjusting to a new currency. As much as my mind can&#39;t intuitively wrap itself around miles, I have a hard time with the feeling of Rupees here in India. Thankfully, the current economic situation provides us with some easy answers.
The present economy helpfully provides us North Americans with a nearly-round conversion rate:
$1 CAD / USD : Rs. 39.1 We can exploit this fact by rounding up to Rs.</description>

      <description>Some lessons I learned before reading this article Rohan showed me today (ironically filed under GTD):
 Get rid of your car. Own less. And less. And less. If you have to own something, own something good. Don&#39;t watch TV. Ever. Do things you love with other people. Do things you hate with other people.  The article, unfortunately, suggests moderation. If you, like me, are incapable of moderation, you almost certainly consume food, alcohol, sleep, and friendship with reckless abandon.</description>

      <description>One of the roadblocks to the Tightpinkproduct is The Gap. My friend installs Ubuntu and complains about the difficulty of installing Flash or forcing WMV files to play inside of Firefox. He shouldn&#39;t have any reason to complain. All these things work. More often than not, they will work with packages living inside repositories. I, too, would complain but I&#39;ve become too used to the routine of installing such packages on top of a default Linux installation (much in the same way I&#39;ve become accustomed to fixing a default Windows installation or patching up OS X).</description>

      <description>I saw Thoughtless Acts a while back and it immediately reminded me of an idea Drew and I came up with years ago. It came to the attention of people who frequented my basement office that if one became engaged in conversation, he or she would inevitably stand on top of some octagonal free weights I had lying around:
Perching oneself on these long enough would lead to fidgeting. The participant would roll them over and gradually get more aggressive by lifting and rotating the weights in various directions.</description>

      <description>Mike (seen here fondling beef) had a blog post about accidentally formatting the wrong partition and losing all his data. Then he went crazy and formatted his entire blog on purpose. What a guy.
In response to his non-existent post, I will engage in a tirade describing where computing has taken me.
First, there was my PC. My first real computer of my very own. At the time I was a poor teenager in secondary school and my options were limited.</description>

      <description>I went for a long walk in the rain. Gosh was it muddy.
I saw a little girl whipping herself and begging for change. A sick, touristy part of me wanted to take a picture of her. An even sicker part of me wanted to borrow the whip to see if the sound it produced was representative of the pain it inflicted. She tugged at my arm as I walked by; I shrugged her off as politely as I could and continued.</description>

      <description>Do you remember the last time you were in the physical presence of an expert? Do you remember how it felt to watch her perform her art? Perhaps hands dancing through the strings of a guitar or over a keyboard. Perhaps instinctual movements producing new material at needlepoint or temporal painting through dance. Perhaps the gentle swing of a chain-saw sliding through the groves of an unfinished ice sculpture. Perhaps it was nothing more than a delicate, natural conversation with your mentor over coffee.</description>
