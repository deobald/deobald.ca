      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Steven! I&amp;rsquo;m a project manager and developer from Halifax. I grow teams and ensure that we build the right product. Lately, I also build, evolve, and maintain backend Rails codebases for companies and non-profits.&#xA;ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º I lived in India for 10 years and I will happily travel there. Halifax has 5+ working hours overlap with any timezone in Europe or North America. I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing code for 30 years, but I will always sweep the floor.</description>

      <description>I recently made two new friends: Abhinav Omprakash and Dawn Walker. Abhinav said I&amp;rsquo;m an optimist and I should write about it. Dawn said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to coin any new terms. I should know better, but this essay follows Abhinav&amp;rsquo;s recommendation &amp;mdash; and credits Dawn, in the very likely event I should have followed her advice instead.&#xA;I have been alive for approximately four decades. Each of those decades was witness to its own fun brand of computering.</description>

      <description>In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harari repeatedly emphasizes the need for society to apply critical thinking to the future of software, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Harari is one of the more forward-thinking philosophers when it comes to disruptive technology and 21 Lessons lucidly collects the requirements for our species&amp;rsquo; future: our new tools must sustainably respect future arcs of aggregate data use and they must do so globally.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer and Full Disclosure: I began writing this article in July, during my last week at nilenso. Go-Jek is a client of nilenso&amp;rsquo;s. My views represent neither company.&#xA;I just re-read Steve Yegge&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Why I left Google to join Grab&amp;rdquo; article. My heart is pumping. I&amp;rsquo;m excited. Just not in the way he intended.&#xA;You may have forgotten about Yegge&amp;rsquo;s article between the beginning and end of 2018 so feel free to go back and refresh your memory.</description>
