      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m already a big fan of Boring Technology, but that term normally applies (and, within McKinley&amp;rsquo;s 2015 essay, certainly applies) only to tools for software development and not to apps and services.&#xA;I want to use that term everywhere.&#xA;The same principles &amp;mdash; that a tool need not be new, flashy, shiny, complicated, intricate, or the absolute perfect fit &amp;mdash; apply everywhere. Liquid Glass is dragging my iPhone 11 SE into a deep dark pit of performance collapse, despite the fact it&amp;rsquo;s every bit the useful little pocket computer it was back in 2020.</description>

      <title>LocalFirst: You Keep Using That Word</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following the local-first scene over the past few years, you already know a good definition for the term &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo; is hard to pin down.&#xA;Part of the reason is that most people write software for money &amp;hellip; and true local-first software is harder to capitalize. &amp;ldquo;Local-first&amp;rdquo; is a direct attack on vendor lock-in of all forms: data, formats, protocols, apps, services, and even environments. But the fact your employer can&amp;rsquo;t exploit this technology with a new revenue model (yet) is a minor problem.</description>

      <description>preface: As a requirement of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign the gag letter Robert McQueen sent me. However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation&amp;rsquo;s directors, past and present. Some of the following may read as criticism.&#xA;reference nick&amp;rsquo;s video&#xA;I still have no idea what happened in August. I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to believe I never will. The board&amp;rsquo;s decision from August 12th was never discussed with me and I was never provided any reason for it.</description>

      <title>Third Wave (Commercial) Open Source</title>

      <description>Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) is an only-loosely-agreed-upon term for businesses built upon selling open source products. COSS has seen two significant waves pass, with a third now emerging. The head of each wave lasts approximately a decade. The tail of each wave extends into the future indefinitely. Each wave subsumes all previous waves.&#xA;The first wave was characterized by shrinkwrapping and commercial support. Peaking in the mid-1990s, Red Hat was the poster-child of selling support for software written by other people.</description>
