      <description>From the original local-first essay (or its pdf version) to Martin Kleppmann&amp;rsquo;s much-simplified inversion of Leslie Lamport&amp;rsquo;s definition of a distributed system:&#xA;In local-first software, the availability of another computer should never prevent you from working.&#xA;&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s been difficult to get a handle on a good definition for &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo;. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided the reason for this is because &amp;ldquo;local-first&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t a binary label we can cleanly apply to something.

      <description>Commercial Open Source Software (COSS) is an only-loosely-agreed-upon term for businesses built upon selling open source products. COSS has seen two significant waves pass, with a third now emerging. The head of each wave lasts approximately a decade. The tail of each wave extends into the future indefinitely. Each wave subsumes all previous waves.&#xA;The first wave was characterized by shrinkwrapping and commercial support. Peaking in the mid-1990s, Red Hat was the poster-child of selling support for software written by other people.</description>
