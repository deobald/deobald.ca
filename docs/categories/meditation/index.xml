      <description>Two weeks ago, a friend struck up a conversation with me about his meditation practice. His query was:
 Hi Steve,  I started meditating like a month ago. Nothing fancy, just sitting down and observing my breath. I did it because my anxiety was really, really bad and I couldn’t sleep at all most nights. It was horrible. At first the meditation made no difference. But then things started improving.</description>

      <description>For those of us who grew up in the 1990s (Gen-Y-ers? Pre-Millennials?), the sound of connecting was
 Pshhhkkkkkkrrrrkakingkakingkakingtshchchchchchchchcchdingding*ding
 and there was a certain romance to the ritual of Getting On The Internet. At least, there is a certain romance now, looking back. Now that we live in the era which precedes the era of ubiquitous computing, with all our nerdy fantasies fulfilled, the internet is everywhere and the ritual is our lives.</description>

      <title>Does Smoking Marijuana Harm Your Meditation Practice?</title>

      <description>tl;dr: Yes, it does.
 A friend with very little drug experience recently asked me if smoking (or eating) marijuana would harm her nascent meditation practice. She had a few follow-up questions, one of which was &amp;ldquo;have you ever written about this?&amp;rdquo; which caused me to turn our conversation into this essay.
First off, on the broad topic of drugs and meditation, I have written about my experiences and categorized the options once before in Drugs, Meditation, Warnings.</description>

      <title>The Toxic Notification Bubble</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I only have two goals for my kids,&amp;rdquo; Paige announced calmly as she set her chai down. &amp;ldquo;One, I don’t want them to be assholes; they shouldn’t mistreat anybody; they should be nice people. And two, I don’t want them to become substance abusers.&amp;rdquo;
It is natural for people our age to worry about drug addiction in the upcoming generation. During the 80s, our impressionable childhood years we were filled with a multitude of tax-funded warnings.</description>

      <title>What is Siggu.org?</title>
      <link>https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2018-12-21-what-is-siggu-org/</link>

      <guid>https://www.deobald.ca/essays/2018-12-21-what-is-siggu-org/</guid>
      <description>We started siggu.org with the very rough intention of answering one question: Why meditate? We have multiple axes across which we will write in an attempt to answer this question: neuroscience, infrastructure, policy, and health &amp;mdash; among others.
Siggu itself is a Pali word. It means horseradish. There is nothing particularly special about a horseradish. It is a strong taste, one that most people grow into with time. The taste changes with the age of the horseradish and planting it demands multiple growing seasons before the first harvest.</description>

      <title>Drugs, Meditation, Warnings</title>

      <description>I recently returned to work from my second 10-day Vipassana course. After such a course, friends are always curious about the experience. Because Vipassana meditation courses are largely indescribable, the conversation often drifts to one&#39;s journey toward Vipassana, and the journey toward meditation in general. For me, this journey has been a mixture of friendships, literature, and drugs. Drugs can be seen as a stepping-stone to my current meditation practice because a few drugs have similar insightful (informational) qualities.</description>

      <description>I recently suffered the most severe injuries of my life &amp;mdash; I experienced a retinal tear and detachment which led to multiple surgeries. Those surgeries themselves have permanently damaged my vision and physically deformed my right eye. While I was recovering, I was unable to read, use a computer, or watch video. Oh. And I was in California, on business. The surgeries prevented me from flying so I was unable to go home to India or home-home to Canada.</description>

      <description>One of the benefits of working for a startup like C42 Engineering (where I help build rubymonk.com &amp;mdash; the name is a coincidence) is the broad range of experiences available, both in and out of the office. Thanks to our flexible work environment, I was able to travel to Himachal Pradesh for a couple weeks of experimenting on myself as a break from experimenting with software. I know not everyone enjoys such benefits, so let me start by saying this: I am thankful.</description>
