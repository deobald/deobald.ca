      <description>When I moved to Bangalore six years ago, I had no interest in India&amp;rsquo;s garbage management problem. I moved here to build a software company, not to muck about with garbage bins. But every time I would fly between the subcontinent and the Americas, I would find relief on my home continent and exhaustion on my continent of immigration. Living in a giant garbage heap is mentally taxing. Every moment spent outdoors is either an angsty mental rundown of how I might help, complete with acute feelings of powerlessness, or searching for someone to blame (my brain&amp;rsquo;s lazy personal favourite is a generic and completely unhelpful &amp;ldquo;the middle class&amp;rdquo;).</description>
