    <p>It&rsquo;s been half a decade since I updated my personal reading list.
Seems like as good a time as any to create another little time capsule.</p>
<h2 id="i-want-to-read">I want to read</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to keep this list shorter.
Hopefully I&rsquo;ll revisit this document with a new version in 2026.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>House of Leaves</em>, Danielewski</li>
<li><em>The Buddha before Buddhism</em>, Fronsdal</li>
<li><em>The Body Keeps the Score</em>, van der Kolk</li>
<li><em>Gideon the Ninth</em>, Muir</li>
<li><em>How to Invent Everything</em>, North</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67034748">Goodreads</a>.
It&rsquo;s kind of a mess, though.</p>
<h2 id="i-am-reading">I am reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Nexus</em>, Harari</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-have-read">I have read</h2>
<p>In no particular order.
I&rsquo;m missing a bunch, but these are recent books that were either good enough, bad enough, or frustrating enough to remember.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Founder&rsquo;s Dilemmas</em>, Wasserman: 1 star. This could have been an A4.</li>
<li><em>A Timeless Way of Building</em>, <em>A Pattern Language</em>, <em>Notes on the Synthesis of Form</em>, Alexander: Stop applying these to software and just read them in their own right. They are so good. (Re-read.)</li>
<li><em>Exhalation</em>, Chiang: Excellent.</li>
<li><em>Reinventing Organizations</em>, Laloux: If he ever does a new edition where he drops <em>Sounds True, Inc.</em> from the list of case studies, this book is probably worthy of 5 stars. I love the thesis, and as someone who also loves Capital-C Co-operatives, I also love that he challenges my prior beliefs, since there isn&rsquo;t a single co-op in the book.</li>
<li><em>Poor Economics</em>, Banerjee: Lord love a duck, what a frustrating book. There are lots of interesting nuggets in here. (Did you know a human being can get all required nutrients from just eggs and bananas?) But there&rsquo;s also a lot of flawed logic.</li>
<li><em>Journey of Insight Meditation: A Personal Experience of the Buddha&rsquo;s Way</em>, Lerner: This is a pretty darn good first-hand account of someone&rsquo;s earnest attempt to learn meditation. Probably the only book of its kind but it won&rsquo;t be for everyone.</li>
<li><em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em>, Chabon: EXCELLENT. I find I rarely enjoy fiction these days, but this was a delight in every <em>single</em> sentence.</li>
<li><em>Prophet Song</em>, Lynch: 2 stars, do not recommend</li>
<li><em>Lessons in Chemistry</em>, Garmus: 1 star. Rape your main character on page 15, get zero respect from me. Designed to be a TV show. Surprise! It&rsquo;s on Apple TV.</li>
<li><em>Butter Honey Pig Bread</em>, Ekwuyasi: Entire chunks of the storyline didn&rsquo;t line up. The writing is amateur. I didn&rsquo;t enjoy this.</li>
<li><em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em>, Zevin: 4 stars, pokes my every nostalgia button. Also excellent writing. A great read after <em>Hackers</em>.</li>
<li><em>Hackers</em>, Levy: Every developer should read this.</li>
<li><em>The Employees</em>, Ravn: ??? stars, I didn&rsquo;t know this was an abstract art piece when I read it. Wups.</li>
<li><em>S. N. Goenka: Emissary of Insight</em>, Stuart: 1 star, the author knows some things. The author is a collosal pain in the ass who assumes he knows much more than he actually knows, both about Goenka and about Indian culture in general. White people who haven&rsquo;t lived in India probably just shouldn&rsquo;t write these kinds of books? I dunno. Or just keep your thinly-veiled criticism on your blog.</li>
<li><em>The Birth of Insight</em>, Braun: Ledi Sayadaw was a remarkable and influential figure, no doubt, but Braun can be a little fawning at times. Still, he at least cites all his sources, unlike Stuart (above) whose citations mostly amount to &ldquo;a guy at my yoga studio said he heard that&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
<li><em>Greenwood</em>, Christie: 3 or 4 stars&hellip; a fun multi-generational bite-sized epic. Do not believe the reviews that say this book is about climate change; it&rsquo;s not.</li>
<li><em>Freedom from the Known</em>, Krishnamurti: 4 stars, always a blessing.</li>
<li><em>The Three-Body Problem</em>, Liu/Cixin: 5 stars.</li>
<li><em>The Paper Menagerie</em>, Liu: 1 star. I do not enjoy Liu&rsquo;s writing, just his translation.</li>
<li><em>Clear and Simple As the Truth</em>, Turner/Thomas: 4 stars, this is some arrogant hand-waving but these fellows are incredibly talented hand-wavers. Gets very repetitive about 60% of the way through.</li>
<li><em>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em>, Eghbal: 0 stars. I fear if Eghbal ever reads my review, it will make her sad. I don&rsquo;t want to do that. But no book has ever made me quite so angry as this one. It is very poorly researched and very badly written.</li>
<li><em>On Writing Well</em>, Zinsser: Meh.</li>
<li><em>Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book</em>, Ingram: 0 stars, I was forced to re-read this for research purposes.</li>
<li><em>Conversations Regarding the Fatalistic Outlook of the Common Man</em>, Manickavel: 4 stars, you should read Kuzhali if you can find her books.</li>
<li><em>Ada, or Ardor</em>, Nabokov: 4 stars, extremely pretentious but maybe Nabokov&rsquo;s writing deserves it. Revisited, not re-read.</li>
</ul>
