    <p>Mike (seen <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.co.uk/who-we-are/our-people/profiles/Aleksiuk,+Michael.html">here</a> fondling beef) had a <a href="http://mybillyboiled.blogspot.com/2007/04/dont-format-c.html">blog post</a> about accidentally formatting the wrong partition and losing all his data. Then he went crazy and formatted his entire blog on <em>purpose</em>. What a guy.</p>
<p>In response to his non-existent post, I will engage in a tirade describing where computing has taken me.</p>
<p>First, there was my PC. My first real computer of my very own. At the time I was a poor teenager in secondary school and my options were limited. Gateway 2000 (still charging extra for Holstein-style cardboard boxes) and Dell were not the most affordable girls on 8th street. No, with only a lifeguard's salary and some babysitting money I was forced to be frugal. I needed Helga&hellip; on the darkest corner&hellip; with sweat pants on. Preferably those sweat pants would be two or three sizes too small and I could knock a few more dollars off. Do you know how little a lifeguard is paid?</p>
<p>And so, I invested in a little computer company with an ugly web page, terrible service and cheap parts. My computer was addressed with &ldquo;SK&rdquo; (for Saskatchewan), but without &ldquo;Canada&rdquo;, and made a fun journey to Slovakia during the long months between my order placement and the eventual arrival.</p>
<p>But it did come. And when it finally came, I enjoyed a long and glorious marriage to Windows 95. That was not to last, however. As I grew older and bought more computers I had to keep buying software. Software I really didn't find that valuable. &ldquo;Why does Microsoft Office cost $400?&rdquo; I'd wonder. Word is basically Notepad stocked with fonts and tables. I'm sure I don't use Excel for anything VisiCalc couldn't handle. PowerPoint? I'd rather just draw on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>And so, as the years passed and my purchases turned to theft, I decided there must be a better way. Linux and OpenOffice was a short-lived affair. I still use Linux and it's pleasant, but I'm not going to pretend the open source world often provides me with software that makes me giddy.</p>
<p>Then, one day, Google quietly released Gmail. I say quietly, because most normal people (not you, likely, if you're reading this blog) still don't even know Google has an email service. Google doesn't advertise &mdash; and it shows. However, Gmail quickly became the golden hammer that replaced every other application I was using. Search, it turns out, is really important; Google has a pretty good handle on that, I guess.</p>
<p>As more years passed I stopped using desktop applications. Full stop. I use Google Documents instead of Word. I use Google Spreadsheets instead of Excel. I use Google Mail for email. I use Picasa Web Albums to organize my photos. I use del.icio.us to bookmark webpages. I use Google Reader for the news. I use Google Calendar to organize my time. I use Strongspace to store my files. If someone forces me to create slides (barf), I'll use HTML; the browser is my operating system now.</p>
<p>It wasn't until after I'd made this change that I started traveling semi-regularly. I'd get on a plane and my laptop would be nothing but a husk, a corpse. Without the internet &ndash; without my applications and data &ndash; it was nothing but a $2000 Solitaire machine.</p>
<p>Recently Google released <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Gears</a> as open source. Mozilla has <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Online/Offline_Events">Offline Events</a> planned for Firefox 3. Things are looking up. With software this good, I'll never have a reason to get away from Google and that frightens me. Here's hoping <a href="http://wikimedia.org/">The Wikimedia Foundation</a> overtakes them soon.</p>
