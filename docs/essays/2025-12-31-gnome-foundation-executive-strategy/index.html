    <p>preface: As a requirement of receiving my last paycheque, I did sign the gag letter Robert McQueen sent me. However, I retained the right to be critical of the Foundation&rsquo;s directors, past and present. Some of the following may read as criticism.</p>
<p>I still have no idea what happened in August. I&rsquo;m beginning to believe I never will. The board&rsquo;s decision from August 12th was never discussed with me and I was never provided any reason for it. From my side of the table, that total lack of communication was a serious problem, unto itself. But I could see the writing on the wall during GUADEC, which is why my keynote was 90% easter eggs. Even so, it has a lot of my strategic thinking baked into it and I&rsquo;d encourage you to revisit that talk if you&rsquo;re interested in the strategy I laid out for the Foundation while I was briefly ED.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>focus on the mission</p>
<ul>
<li>it is illegal not to follow the 501c3 mission</li>
<li>certain directors quietly push for politics in the foundation</li>
<li>contrast: PSF makes clear decisions wrt their presence in the US, when they pertain directly to the PSF mission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>focus on the institution</p>
<ul>
<li>link podcast</li>
<li>succession planning</li>
<li>financial stability</li>
<li>organizational excellence</li>
<li>diversity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="succession-planning">succession planning</h2>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;death&rdquo; - david, aaron, 501c3 good governance</li>
<li>nurture the next generation: Design Team as good example</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="financial-stability">financial stability</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fiscal policy</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce costs</li>
<li>focus on MRR/ARR</li>
<li>aside: Ankur&rsquo;s shock at Foundation budgets</li>
<li>balance the budget, YoY</li>
<li>board reserve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>fundraising</p>
<ul>
<li>slide deck (costs can be derived from 990s)</li>
<li>d.g.o</li>
<li>fund development</li>
<li>talk about gnome on podcasts, youtube</li>
<li>stop Canonical from patching out Donate notification in Ubuntu</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organizational-excellence">Organizational Excellence</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>board</p>
<ul>
<li>I had it backwards: hackers make good directors</li>
<li>where are our Canonical friends? &ndash; they&rsquo;re on the Ad Board; get them memberships and get them on the board, too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>policy governance</p>
<ul>
<li>this would still be my preference but, after August, I&rsquo;m not convinced it&rsquo;s a good idea for the Foundation to have a staff ED &hellip; no one wants to work for 9 bosses who ghost you for weeks at a time.</li>
<li>perhaps the current situation is the best possible outcome: have the board accept that they&rsquo;re deeply involved in the foundation&rsquo;s executive activities anyway, and maintain a community executive, rather than staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>shift to infrastructure</p>
<ul>
<li>operational struggles</li>
<li>infra doesn&rsquo;t have this problem: bart and andrea are excellent and very trustworthy</li>
<li>banking has been moved into the treasury function (pres, treasurer), non-banking tools should move into infra: Stripe, Wise.com, etc.</li>
<li>automate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>accountability, feedback, open honest comm</p>
<ul>
<li>private chan in matrix</li>
<li>private area in discourse?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>
<ul>
<li>corporate diversity (spread out Red Hat risk)</li>
<li>more diversity in hackers, not the board
<ul>
<li>the board is made of members; don&rsquo;t force board diversity if it&rsquo;s not there in the membership; solve the root problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>broaden the base: bring in more app developers</li>
<li>focus less on outreach programs like Outreachy and GSoC (which would help unburden Felipe, also) and focus more on mid- to senior-level developers.</li>
</ul>
