Relevant files:

```
src/config.toml                         # global config
src/content/essays                      # essays section
src/layouts/partials/header/custom.html # hook to custom CSS
src/static/css/deobald.css              # custom CSS
src/static/img                          # content images go here
```

The current theme is `hyde-hyde` and the location of the hook for custom CSS may change if the theme is switched. At the time of this writing, custom CSS is only used to center images so hopefully switching the hook isn't difficult.
